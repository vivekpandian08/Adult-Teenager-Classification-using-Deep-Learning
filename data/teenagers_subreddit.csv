teenagers,"Dear teen boys,","If a girl you have a crush on says she's not interested in you, TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER. Please don't ""keep trying"", we're not just playing hard to get.

If a girl says she has a crush on you but you're not interested in her, YOU CAN SAY NO. It doesn't make you weird or picky or ""gay"". Don't force yourself into a relationship just so you can seem cool or just so you don't hurt her feelings.

Saying no is a valid response that has to be respected by both sides.","Dear teen boys, If a girl you have a crush on says she's not interested in you, TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER. Please don't ""keep trying"", we're not just playing hard to get.

teenagers,Internet girlfriend,"Hi guys. I just wanna warn you. Do not get too involved in internet relationships cuz you may get harmed. Here's my story.
I meet a girl on a discord server about reptiles.
We were chatting and other things like that. Sometimes she was very depressed and I tried to help her. Our discussion went into dms. There she sent me a photo that proved she was harming herself. She was bitting herself so hard that she had scars from it. I should have  gtfo of there but I felt something to her. Or so I thought. I was chatting with her and trying to raise her spirits and it worked. I asked her out the next day. She agreed. I was very happy but the happiness didn't last long. I tried to call her on discord but she dismissed the call. Apparently she had so severe social anxiety that she suffered panic attack because of my call. Her only social interactions were with her parents and people discord. From that point she regularly told me that she was worthless and that she should die. That messages broke my heart. For a week I was living in a fear that she would hurt herself. Thank God I had friends that supported me. I was so afraid that I was crying at night from stress. Our conversations every time went from me complimenting her to discussions about death and me trying to convince her to go see a specialist.
Also when I was saying things like I love you she responded with things like I shouldn't agree to be with you I'm not worth it. She was making me afraid of breaking up with her because she could commit suicide after our breakup. 
I broke up with her because she I couldn't handle the constant fear about her.
I was constantly talking with my friends about that situation. One of them is a admin on that reptile server. She convinced whole server staff to ban my ex because of her manipulative and toxic behavior.
To my surprise my ex changed her behavior and she wasn't depressed anymore and tried to convince admins to unban her. 
After breaking up with her I learned that she was trying to manipulate me into staying with her by making me afraid of her killing herself. 
I blocked her everywhere.","Internet girlfriend Hi guys. I just wanna warn you. Do not get too involved in internet relationships cuz you may get harmed. Here's my story.

teenagers,i miss him so much even though i probably shouldn’t,"months ago i met a guy, we talked for a while and he asked me to be his gf. he was really sweet and we talked pretty much all day every day. he sent me good morning/ goodnight texts, he would say he loved me and wanted to make me happy. it was the first time in a long time i felt happy at all. 

but than he started doing things like begging me for nudes than not responding tell the next day if i didn’t send, and he kind of cheated on me. i confronted him about the cheating thing (he was talking to another girl about possibly dating her) and he cried and stuff so i kinda forgave him but i probably shouldn’t have. than he started ghosting me for a few days at a time but i tried to not worry about it because someone he knew passed away and i knew he was sad about it. than after he had stopped messaging me for like 3 days we started a conversation and he apologized and said he missed me but immediately tried to make it sexual and when i changed the subject he stopped messaging me again for 10 days. i asked if he was okay and stuff and he responded and told me he was but stopped talking to me again. 2 days ago i sent him a message asking if we could talk, because i was going to break up with him and he still hasn’t opened it

i really hope he doesn’t see this because he posts all the time in this subreddit how he’s lonely and feels like no one loves him and wished he had someone to hug and stuff. he even posted something about how his friend who was a girl moved and he misses her and she’s the “only one he has” and the only one he likes being around 24/7. and she’s the only one who didn’t tell him to man up when he cried, which i didn’t either so idk. i definitely don’t think he knows i saw the post but it fuckin hurt to read. i don’t know what i did wrong i’m so fucking sad right now","i miss him so much even though i probably shouldn’t months ago i met a guy, we talked for a while and he asked me to be his gf. he was really sweet and we talked pretty much all day every day. he sent me good morning/ goodnight texts, he would say he loved me and wanted to make me happy. it was the first time in a long time i felt happy at all.

teenagers,I was scammed :/,"Let me explain: 

Today I made a chatbot for Omegle and Discord. All it did was type out either the Shrek or Bee Movie script. Good fun, and I met one dude who said he was into programming too so after a conversation I sent him the source code via discord with instructions. It was going to be free to the public anyways, so it confuses me as to why he STOLE it, AND THEN BLOCKED ME. He probably is selling it, because I have seen a few people on various servers trying to sell chatbots. Anyways, a clip of the conversation can be seen here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cxisVYl4yn\_lcG6QYwEClMPW3vx3g8Cq/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cxisVYl4yn_lcG6QYwEClMPW3vx3g8Cq/view?usp=sharing)

Anyways, even though I don't mind sharing it, it still pisses me off that he just stole it. 

So, r/teenagers, do your absolute worst.

Normally, I wouldn't do this, but screw this guy. Show him theft doesn't pay.

Try to message him and friend him at  **Josia#9270** and tell him to unblock JGamer212. Maybe if enough of you try it will work.

teenagers,So I preordered Cyberpunk 2077,Like the title says a preordered it and then I told my friend and he asked why I wasted my money on it ( he likes more realistic games but hes willing to give cyberpunk a go) I then told him i technically didnt pay for it as the EB games ( game stop for you Americans out there) had a deal that if you trade 2 games you can preorder it for $30. Still doesnt make sense why I didnt pay anything? Its because I traded in 5 games i dont play anymore and got a store credit of like 100 bucks and used the credit to pay for it.

teenagers,"Scientifically, I don’t understand LGBTQ+","Ok so every single organism’s goal is to reproduce. Of course humans sometimes won’t want to reproduce. That’s understandable, even I am considering not having kids. Not wanting kids is a learned behavior. Now here is the problem, I doubt someone was born with a liking for a gender they couldn’t reproduce with for evolutionary reasons. There is no point in humans to be naturally attracted to a gender they can’t reproduce with. I think that we all come out as blank slates and learn to like things such as art etc. This may also have to do with being LGBTQ+. I’m open to discussion, but this is NOT an attack on LGBTQ+.","Scientifically, I don’t understand LGBTQ+ Ok so every single organism’s goal is to reproduce.

teenagers,Idk if I'm doing something wrong but sometimes girls start avoiding me for no reason,"I never get into drama and I'm never mean or rude to anyone. There was this one girl I kinda liked and we had been talking for weeks and then one day she stopped. It's not like she hates me because she still laughs at my jokes occasionally but whenever I'm near her, sometimes she just walks off and I can never tell if it's just a coincidence or not. This happened with some other girls too. Should I try and start conversation and hope she doesn't leave or something? What am I doing wrong?","Idk if I'm doing something wrong but sometimes girls start avoiding me for no reason I never get into drama and I'm never mean or rude to anyone.

teenagers,A poem I made to celebrate the end of NNN,"##The brain and the dick

By u/shadow938

The brain is at the top,

The heart is in the middle

The dick is at the bottom

The brain says “no!”

But the heart runs free

Blood drifts through the veins

It flows through the brain

And the dick as well

The brain denounces

The dick rises

Everything is pulled to the ground by gravity

But the dick is standing 

Like a lone champion

Who rejects to be defiled by the dust on the ground

The brain commands the hand to take the dick

Torturing, squeezing

Deceiving the most passionate desires

With the most despicable tricks

The dick falls eventually

In the sweetest lies

Is the hopeless nights

He loses everything

The gravity pulls the dick to the ground

Where all the dust at

Where all the seeds lie

The one who loses stays in silence

The one who wins is wailing

For the victory that can never be reached!

Because he knows

When the night fades

When the morning birds starts singing

His old friend

Will be standing again in the rising sun...","A poem I made to celebrate the end of NNN ##The brain and the dick

I don't bite them when they've been used or have soap- but if I get a fresh one out and get it wet before I use it to wash my body, I bite that shit, I haven't done it in a while though.



Just for the nostalgia I guess. I dunno, biting wash clothes is one of my only pleasant child hood memories...that and looking for crickets with my neighbour. It's embarrassing to admit but I wouldn't say its as bad as people who chew on sand paper or corn starch.

teenagers,A rant about my home life,When I woke up this morning I was so fucking tired I have no idea why I slept for 8 hours I just couldn’t stay awake so I went downstairs and ate breakfast and laid on the couch when my mom came over to talk to me about getting a project done and I said that I’d get it done tomorrow because I had work in two hours and then I went upstairs to take a nap before driving to work. She found me asleep woke me up and started yelling about how my apathy towards everything is gonna ruin my life and that she’s gonna kick me out of the house and she won’t put up with this. She then asked me why I was apathetic and I told her I didn’t know because I don’t know it’s just hard for me to get motivated to do anything and she said I was lying and told me to just go to work. This comes right off from an incident a few days ago when i told her I was feeling suicidal (after I wrote a note and decided to tell someone) at which she yelled at me how I was manipulative and this is just like my dad(whom I have cut contact with as he was a strong negative influence in my life) and that I was lying. She then said if I didn’t change she’d force me out due to my bad decisions because being kicked out makes me sound like the victim. I’m just so sick of trying to change and get better and falling flat on my face I just want to go back a year and fix my mistakes or to just die idk what to do anymore as without a place to stay I will never get a higher education and will be forced to work the dead end fast food job I currently work at.,A rant about my home life When I woke up this morning I was so fucking tired I have no idea why I slept for 8 hours I just couldn’t stay awake so I went downstairs and ate breakfast and laid on the couch when my mom came over to talk to me about getting a project done and I said that I’d get it done tomorrow because I had work in two hours and then I went upstairs to take a nap before driving to work.

teenagers,Open sex talk on r/teenagers helps prevent pedos and creeps!,"This isn't some kind of diss track or retaliation post but I saw a post about how open sex talk on the subreddit helps r/teenagers become a breeding ground for pedos and creeps but I believe it does the exact opposite.

Most times, little kids and teenagers are drawn to pedos and creeps for grooming because they either

1. do not have anyone else to talk to about sexual stuff.
2. feel embarrassed talking to people they know about sexual stuff or
3. just don't know much about all this sex stuff.

Those are the major reasons pedos and creeps are able to draw minors online. They provide a ""safe space"" to talk about sex without being ashamed and embarrassed and they claim to be able to ""teach"" one about sex. and as soon as the minor is in, they convince the minor that they can't talk to anyone else and scare them into believing that they'll get into trouble for reporting the pedo/creep.

Regardless of whether we discuss sex openly or not, DMs are still private and creeps will still try to lure in minors and abuse them but giving teenagers an open and safe space to discuss and express themselves actually helps so that people fall for that shit less. We should be able to talk about sex, abuse, puberty and everything that teenagers go through.","Open sex talk on r/teenagers helps prevent pedos and creeps!

teenagers,My brother is a manipulative little shit,"Our mother suffers from clinical depression and stress, she loves us more than anything though and has never treated us bad. My little brother takes advantage of her for more computer time and money. He has stolen money from her several times(even though he’s only 10), most of the time stealing her credit cards when she isn’t looking and using the code he remembered or wrote down from when she bought him something on the computer before.

Especially when she’s sad or more often really tired he makes it all about him(most frequently when she catches him using his phone or iPad after 1 in the morning), sobbing and screaming about how she only wants to see him sad and blaming her for making him stay up all night because he’s now angry. He often speaks in an angry or aggressive tone and then gets super defensive and pissed off when people mention it or ask what’s wrong, most of the time it’s our mom who becomes his punching bag.

He’s happy as can be when he buys new stuff on the computer, he screams and cries when he doesn’t get to use it. He’s irresponsible and never does anything he’s supposed to. His lizard has almost starved because he didn’t feed it and didn’t tell us. Mom doesn’t ask much of us, often just small things like taking out the dishes or walking the dog. When she asks him, he either ignores(claiming that he forgot) or screams at her because he has to take a 10 minute break from sitting on his ass for 16 hours a day to get his clean, folded laundry. He’s too dumb to realize how damaging this is to her and I always have to take over his responsibilities to prevent her having unnecessary stress.

He’s an ignorant, self-absorbed asshole. Drowning him in a well or throwing him on a train to live in Tanzania for a couple months so he can see how good he has it are both very attractive options.","My brother is a manipulative little shit Our mother suffers from clinical depression and stress, she loves us more than anything though and has never treated us bad.

When she asks him, he either ignores(claiming that he forgot) or screams at her because he has to take a 10 minute break from sitting on his ass for 16 hours a day to get his clean, folded laundry. He’s too dumb to realize how damaging this is to her and I always have to take over his responsibilities to prevent her having unnecessary stress.

He’s an ignorant, self-absorbed asshole. Drowning him in a well or throwing him on a train to live in Tanzania for a couple months so he can see how good he has it are both very attractive options."

teenagers,Should I Call The Police on My Mom For Saying I did Marijuana?,"This may seem like an exaggerated response, But please read. About a year ago, my mom went on a business trip. When she returned, I was met by accusations of me doing marijuana. I tried my best to tell her she was mistaken, but she did not listen. At the time, I was seeing a therapist, so I decided to tell her. The therapist suggested that I get a drug test, because she knew the proper people to do so. My mom declined, saying once again she had enough proof. This morning, my mom accused me for the second time of doing marijuana. I asked her for proof and any other identifying factors that could make her say that. My mom has been working from home almost every day since COVID first started.  I asked her questions to try and appeal do her better nature like “How could I do it when you were home all day” and “How could I buy it I don’t have any money” along with “Wouldn’t you smell it?” And once again, she said she didn’t need to show anything and I’m just trying to gaslight her.  I feel powerless because my family members live far away, and my mom won’t let me hang out with friends. The first time she accused me she has said the first time she ever finds more she will get me locked up. It’s like she just tormenting me over nothing. I really have no other person to turned to that could help. So my thought now is to just call the police and let them handle it. If she had such proof, she would most certainly hand it over to them. I informed her I would call them, but she blew me off. It is 5:40 pm and I plan on calling them if I cannot find another way.","Should I Call The Police on My Mom For Saying I did Marijuana?

Valve co-founder Gabe Newell said the team aimed to create an immersive world rather than a ""shooting gallery"". They built Half-Life using GoldSrc, a heavily modified version of the Quake engine, licensed from id Software.

Half-Life received acclaim for its graphics, realistic gameplay, and seamless narrative. It won over fifty PC ""Game of the Year"" awards and is considered one of the most influential FPS games as well as one of the best video games ever made. By 2008, it had sold over 9 million copies. It was followed by the expansion packs Opposing Force (1999) and Blue Shift (2001), developed by Gearbox Software. It was ported to the PlayStation 2 in 2001, along with another expansion Half-Life: Decay, and to macOS and Linux in 2013. Valve ported Half-Life to its Source engine in 2004, while a third-party remake, Black Mesa, was released in 2020.","Yo im horny as shit below is my snap Unlike many other games at the time, in half life the player has almost uninterrupted control of Freeman, and the story is told mostly through scripted sequences seen through his eyes.

4 there is so much joy in the air during Christmas that it fills you up with warmth!

teenagers,A weird thing I remembered,"When I was little my mom was going out to the store and took me with her. Before we left I said I was hungry and she gave me an apple to eat. I didn't like apples, but I ate it anyway. I was a very slow eater and ate it on the way to the store. By the time we're there I still have half my apple left. When we walk in a big employee sees me with my apple and tells my mom I can't eat that in there. He then picks me up and sit me in a filing cabinet until I'm done. I almost cried as he stared at me as I only took a bite. I said I didn't want it anymore and he took me off the shelf and continued shopping with my mom.

Tldr: I brought an apple into a clothing store while employee wouldn't let me do anything until I was done.","A weird thing I remembered When I was little my mom was going out to the store and took me with her.

teenagers,Do you like water? I do.,"Just imagine your at home eating Thanksgiving dinner and it was about 8:00PM. As you were about to shut off the tv a target ad pops up on the screen talking about 50%-90% off deals on all items in the store you immediately get up and grab your coat and tent to camp right by the entrance of target so you can at least get some shut eye for the night. You get in your car and speed off into the fading moon of the night listening to Billy Joel on the radio. You arrive at Target and see there are also many campers around the entrance. You set up camp and at this point its about 8:45PM as you set an alarm for 4:00AM to have enough time to get ready in line for 5:00AM, the time they open the store. You close your eyes and drift off to sleep into the night. 

You wake up and look at the clock its about 4:56AM. You mumble under your breath ""Stupid Android, of course the alarm wouldn't go off."" You dit up and hear jingles from a few miles away. You unzip your tent and look outside and in the distance you see a heard of people running..infact there were billions of them. You get a closer look and all of them were dressed up as Santa Claus men, women, teenagers, kids everyone. You look inside the store and see a few Target employees, some standing bold and ready, some crying and hugging, others shooting their heads off. They knew they would die by the impact of a billion santa claus' running at full speed. As you looked back at your phone you realize it was 4:59. You looked back at the herd of Santa Claus'....it was time. The doors stuck open and immediately the crowd had disappeared into the store. You get a closer look and see all of the employees tumbled over and squished to death. You kneel to the blood soaked ground and starts crying infront of the entrance as you see kid Santa Claus' heads getting snapped and stepped on and women Santa Claus' hair getting pulled. Sooner or later the cops arrived but it was too late everyone was dead billions of Santa Claus'...all...dead. It was a riot.","Do you like water? I do.

teenagers,Recruiting people to play Team Fortress 2 until valve gives us a major update or the bots go away. Day 18," 

The game is called Tf2 it's an FPS PC game made by the video game company Valve that also made the Half-life series. It's a really fun game. Main reason I am recruiting people is because if we can start increasing the monthly player number, Valve will get us an update or pay attention to us. Tf2 is a FPS game where there are different game modes such as payload, capture the point, king of the hill, and capture the intelligence. There are also alternative game modes where you can play with friends such as Mann vs. machine. If you don't feel like being a tryhard and playing the objective, you can hop into a 2fort or Hightower server and just mess around with friends.

As it stands now, it is a F2P, however F2P can't use the chat or voice chat. However this can be easily solved by buying a key at the Mann.co store in-game for 2.50 (U.S. dollars). After the purchase its up to you if you want to buy more stuff. It also gives you the privilege of going competitive if you want. You can also buy cosmetics (if you want) and dress your character. Many Tf2 veterans refer to this as a hat simulator because of the amount of hats and cosmetics there are (at least I do).

If you need help getting into the game or want more info, DM and I will be more than happy to respond. It would also help if you joined my newly created subreddit----&gt; [https://www.reddit.com/r/ReconstructingTf2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReconstructingTf2/) It's a subreddit dedicated to help reach out to new players and to reverse the inflation caused by the Crate Depression","Recruiting people to play Team Fortress 2 until valve gives us a major update or the bots go away.

There's another common theory about life in general; that when you die, you live ""another life"" through your conscience.

What if that's how parallel universes are formed? Someone or something dies, and your conscience forms another universe to live in.

Effectively, the universe creates consciousness, and consciousness creates the new universe, creating a never-ending cycle of new universe.","I've just had a thought about consciousness You know the theory of parallel universes, where infinite possibilities exist.

teenagers,I think I was almost kidnapped,"This happened a little over a year ago, but it's bugged me quite a bit since them. 

At the time I had just started to learn how to skateboard. I was skating around my neighborhood, only going a couple blocks away at most just in case I fell and got hurt. 

I turned into a cul-de-sac with a side-walk leading down to a canal which I later realized could have functioned as an escape route. It was a cold day so no one besides me was outside besides a couple of dogs in people's backyards. 

A car turned into the cul-de-sac. I don't remember what color it was, but I remember it having tinted windows. I hoped it would just make a quick turn-around and be on its way. But no luck. 

It stopped and I froze. I cant describe the feeling of my skin prickling and my heart knocking against my rib-cage. Its the feeling of getting to school and remembering you forgot your homework. 

The window rolled down and a guy leaned out. He looked to be on the older side, late 50s maybe, with graying hair and a bit of stubble. 

""Why don't you put that in the back?"" He asked, gesturing to my board. 

""No thanks,"" I said. I remember sounding annoyed, but inside I was fucking terrified. 

He paused. ""Are you Josephine?""

""No,"" I said. He paused again before clearing his throat and wishing me a nice day. He drove off, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was just off about the whole situation. 

I sped home as quick as I could, but the more I think about it the more it bugs me. Why would he not know what this girl, Josephine, looks like if he was picking her up? Further, why would he think it's ok to drive up to a random kid, without first asking who they are, and ask them to get in his car? 

I might be making a big deal out of nothing but I still think about it, and I'm glad nothing else happened. Does anyone else have some thoughts on this? It still freaks me out even thinking that this situation could have escalated into something far worse.","I think I was almost kidnapped This happened a little over a year ago, but it's bugged me quite a bit since them.

One thing you shouldn’t do is call it a terrorist organization, the people you think are terrorist aren’t apart of BLM, they are just freakin bastards. Don’t compare people who crashed 2 planes into buildings killing over thousands of people. Those are terrorist. True BLM supporters care about all races while wanting justice for black people.","People are so disgusting. Probably a little late on this issue but still.

teenagers,The Utah monolith explained.,"As many of you know, a metal bar was found in a desert in Utah. And apparently no one can explain it. So imma bought to explain it. 

Before I do, im not claiming that any of This is true.

The monolith has actually been there since 2016 and it was made by an artist named John McCracken, who has done similar sculptures as the monolith. 

Why people are only now talking about it? Probably because people are running out of things to blame 2020 for.","The Utah monolith explained. As many of you know, a metal bar was found in a desert in Utah. And apparently no one can explain it. So imma bought to explain it.

Squirrels have a terminal velocity of 14 meters a second. 14\*60 = 840 meters a minute. 840\*60 = 50,400 meters an hour. 50400\*24 = 1,209,600 meters a day = ***squirrels can fall 1209.6 kilometers a day***

Squirrels can also survive 24 hours without water, which means, squirrels can survive a fall, as long as it's shorter than 1,209,600 kilometers. For the americans out there, that's  ***3,968,503.9*** ***feet***","Squirrels don't take fall damage I did the math

teenagers,Trying to sort out my feelings for this girl,"My mood is so heavily dependent on one girl it’s almost pathetic, if she replies to me quick or sends me something cute everything’s rosey but if she doesn’t open my text for hours I feel everything going to shit.

 I haven’t really had a crush in ages and I’m not super I would call the feelings I have for her a crush either but I definitely feel some sort of strong emotional connection to her. We’ve been in school together for over a decade but only became friends a couple of years ago and I only began to really catch feelings for her last month - for a brief period of time I was borderline OBSESSED with her and she was pretty much the only thing I could think about all day (pathetic I know, but I suppose it’s normal when you crush on someone after a long time) but then that phase subsided and now I’ve begun to feel a slightly more toned down sense of admiration and feelings for her. 

The issue is at times it feels like my feelings toward her are maybe only platonic or perhaps only birthed out of the loneliness of quarantine- it’s all just a complicated mess in my head. Just a couple of days ago I was thinking about asking her out (cause I think she might just like me back) but all of a sudden I’m having second thoughts about my own feelings....

teenagers,I won my class presidency,"I am not popular really, but I won my class election in a landslide. I’ll explain how you can too: jokes. The position is a joke itself because it’s normally a popularity contest. I won with a joke of a speech/campaign. Basically, for my speech I just put in a ton of jokes, I emailed a really small town (population 150ish) and asked their mayor if he could endorse me for presidency because I once used a gas station in their town passing through. I guess they don’t get a lot of emails so he responded with a short video clip saying ‘I endorse ‘me’ for class president’ and that was part of my speech. I also told the entire class they were really hot. (I’m mot gay tho) In the end, I won.","I won my class presidency I am not popular really, but I won my class election in a landslide.

teenagers,Fuck cancer,"I know I sound like a karmawhore now but fuck it.

When i started fifth grade i got a new teacher, I was ten at the time. My sister had the same teacher for the three years before me so we knew her. When we got to the autumn, just two months after we started she got cancer. Two years and eigth teachers later she died. I was very very sad because we knew her and she kept in touch with us.

Last year i started what would be middle school here in Norway. We were supposed to write an english text for a day, but she did not show up. We had several teachers that day, but no writing. 

I felt a that there something wrong. Later that same day the principal came in to our classroom and said that out new teacher just got cancer. 

Because of this, we had to get a new teacher. We had several substitute teachers, including my dad who also works at my school. 

A few weeks before christmas last year, we got a new permanent substitute teacher and he was amazing. We had the same humor and he was very kind to us. 

After this summerbreak we got yet a new teacher who now is our fulltime teacher and won't leave us like the others.

But here comes more of the sad stuff.

Earlier this year we were told our old teacher with cancer will survive and come back to our school, but on wednesday we were told by our norwegian teacher who is her best friend that she will die. 

The sesond teacher I have had in four/five years who will die from cancer.

FUCK CANCER!!

teenagers,Should I take the time to know my crush.,"Here's the deal: I've never really took the time to know her.

teenagers,Just some thoughts when I couldn't sleep yesterday,"\*This is just some space and timeline theory talk, so if you're not interested in those things keep scrolling. Or stay, by all means, maybe we can have a good discussion together.

So yesterday night I couldn't fall asleep, so I was laying there and thinking about random stuff when I suddenly start thinking about the grandpa paradox. If you don't know what it is I'll explain it in short:

Imagine that you go back in time and kill your grandpa, but if you kill your grandpa then you wouldn't exist, but if you don't exist then your grandpa would still be alive, but if your grandpa is still alive then you would exist and could kill him. See the problem?

So I was trying to find an answer to this paradox, and what I concluded was that every time you change the future, no matter how small the change it, you will create another timeline. Say for example you go back in time and buy a banana, then that means that you would have changed the future (butterfly effect and all that), and that new future is a new timeline that you now live in, while the future that would have been is another timeline. 

If my theory is true, the magnitude of it would be absolutely huge, like unimaginably huge. Because every time a new timeline is created, it would be a copy of the other timeline on the grand scale of things, like the same stars, galaxies, and whatever. That means that create entirely new universes by buying a banana if you go back in time.

What do you guys think about this theory? And please tell me if there's any hole in my theory, cause I'm just a 15 year old dude after all. Or maybe you have another answer to the grandpa paradox, then please do tell.","Just some thoughts when I couldn't sleep yesterday \*This is just some space and timeline theory talk, so if you're not interested in those things keep scrolling.

My friend blocked him and repored his acc and so did i. he was trying to contact me through his second acc but i also blocked that. 

Today my sister walked up to me and said that that this random guy texted her on ig asking if she knew my friend and ofc it was him he was claming that she send him nudes and that is a tottal lie hes soreading this around and idk how many ppl he texted he might do something worse and my friend is really worried so im asking for any kind of help.

To everybody telling me not to pull the trigger, I’m not actually going to do it. I just want to. There’s a difference between wanting to do something and being dumb enough to do it.

It’s a limbo of “that sounds really good to do but it’s also extremely stupid” where each side balances itself out enough to where I won’t actually do anything about my problem, but it’s still there yk?

Kinda like “I wanna start a band and not go to college so we can be famous” it sounds like an awesome idea that has a very small chance of working out so you don’t do it. It’s stupid and you know it is. But you still *want* to.

...

Now on the call today, we talked about relations. (idk how we got onto that topic) Then she told me that she is kinda in love. [Me was very happy, as I got feelings for her].

However, the person she is in love with is the friend of her sister. According to her, she is scared that by sharing her feelings she would hurt the relationship between her sister and him.

Now we phone again tomorrow (video call) and I am lost on how I could help her out of her situation - without ruining any chances I could have.

I know it is a very difficult, but I do not see any solution.

teenagers,"Just asked out my crush of five months, it went well.","Posted this on r/love, but I also wanna share my story here.

Well, I've had a huge crush on her for months, we're both sophomores but go to different schools. We met at this sleep away camp, and well, I loved everything about her. She is smart, funny, rational, beautiful, and just perfect. We spent a lot of time in the lake and pool together, and guys, I'm no expert on picking up signs, but there was some serious tension. Eye contact, brushing each other's hands, very good conversations where we were both genuinely curious, little glances at each other when we saw one another in the mess hall. We were both leaving camp the same day, so I was upset that we might not see each other for awhile. (We swapped numbers, so we still had contact.)

My parents are divorced, so I have to go from one apartment to another quite often. I was at my mom's, when I thought I saw someone familiar across the street, in the lobby of this luxury high rise. I kid you not, I rubbed my eyes, and I walked over there. Holy shit, it was her. I tapped her on the shoulder and she was shocked to see me. That night we went for a walk to grab a coffee, and we just talked about life, and what we wanted to do, and we played 20 questions. It was fun. She went home, and we kept on talking, and hanging out for months. I still felt the tension, but I was worried that I was going to lose her if I didn't pop the question.

So one day, when we were walking in the park, I flat out asked her. ""Listen, I dunno if you like me, if you don't that's fine, and we can still remain friends, but I like you."" She giggled and said that she was worried I wasn't going to ask. Well, that was a month ago and we're doing good. This story might be cringe, and there might be people in the comments who say ""oH, yOu'Re bOtH fIftEEn, yOu kNoW tHaT it'S nOT a gUArenTeeD mArrIagE?"" Yes, I know, but as of now, it's going good, and that's all that matters, I'm not expecting to spend the rest of my life with her, but I'd be okay with spending the rest of my life with her, y'know?","Just asked out my crush of five months, it went well.

teenagers,I need some advice on flirting with a girl.,"So obviously there is a girl I like. And we are pretty friendly, enough that I have her number in my phone and we talk from time to time. 

I feel like she likes me but Im kinda nervous. The main reason for me being nervous is that she is about a year older than me, I’m 16 and she’s 17. I guess it seems like girls tend to like guys that are older than them not ones that are younger so it seems weird to me but it really shouldn’t. 

Still I’m like 90% sure that she likes me. She gets really nervous around me. Me and my friends would hang out after school and whenever she went somewhere she would ask me to go with her. She would always try to sit next to me and when she did she would move her leg over so that it was touching mine. 

So she definitely likes me right?

I’m almost certain she does. 

So now that I’ve figured that out I was hit with this wave of confidence and I’m thinking that I should try to flirt with her a bit but I don’t want to be too obvious. 

I would prefer that it be subtle. For example I could try to compliment her a bit or something like that. But idk. 

I’ve never done this before so I could really use some advice.","I need some advice on flirting with a girl. So obviously there is a girl I like. And we are pretty friendly, enough that I have her number in my phone and we talk from time to time.

teenagers,Just spent an hour helping my grandma with her new laptop through video call,"She is not good with tech-related stuff, but she always calls me when something is up with anyones devices.
So, she retired like 4 months ago but due to covid her retirement gift got delayed untill now.
She got a cool Acer Aspire 3 laptop, some fancy one the company specially put together for her.
She loves it, but wanted to change some stuff on it.
Well, first of all: Charge it.
So i explained that the ""black box"" is important and what cable has to go where.
After getting it on, i helped her change the language and explained some basic stuff to know.
As you might guess, she didn't really position the camera well, but i am glad i got to help her with everything she wanted to get fixed.
She was happy, I am happy, but also extra tired.
Time to relax a little.

teenagers,Id like to tell all of you about my best week ever and the first time I fell in love,"Ik nobody gives a damn ,but this is something I gotta get of my chest 
I remeber it so vividly 

So let’s start 

Once a year during 2 years we go for 1 week to a place where there are 6 teachers and more than 100 students 
We go skiing I have the luck to live pretty close to the Spanish Pyrenees 
To be precise the Navarre Pyrenees (the name of the place I live in English sound weird lol)  so I was on a small town 
I started talking to much more people than I used to 
Like I git the extrovert side of me
One of my friends friend sat in the same table that this girl 
I have another friend I liked more so I didn’t went with him 
But one day ,she saw me solving my rubik’s. Cube (I am gonna admit I ain’t do it that well but it’s fairly impressive if you don’t know anything )
She started asking for scrambling it and timing me ,
While we did so I talked to her ,and we went on for a walk for a while 
This is the closest to a date I have had ,
I am going to admit that I like making myself look interesting 
That’s why my rubik cube and that’s why the next thing 
“This town looks like Derry “ ,it didn’t ,at all ,but she responded 
Like the it town , yeah it does 
This just made go nuts  
“YOU READ STEPHEN KING “
Yeah ,I do 
So we started talking around it ,to me that was all 
I fell In love I one night ,yep 
Fast forward 2 days , I walked up to an awful noise coming from the room next door , my friend came out near me ,and I asked him 
“Pablo what the fuck is going on there “ 
“We are playing truth and dare , I have kissed like 3 girls in five minutes “
“Is hazel (nit the name but it sound similar ) playing “
“Nah dude ,better luck next time “
I went in ,and I saw her sitting in a corner 
Watching people like me ,lonely ,is nice,because it makes me feel like I am not the only , I wanted to sleep so I went back to my room 
I asked her out by text next week , she awnsered no 
We haven’t talked since 
Sometimes I see her on recess and I wanna talk to her 
Like “remeber me ?” , I really wish it had worked out 
Because I can’t tell that she is way more than she looks in the surface 
Outside she looks like any other white girl but I know she ain’t like the other white girls 

Hazel if you are reading this , (I’d you ar reading this I know you know it’s you even if I’m not using your name ) I think you still got my phone number

So It went well… I guess.

  
I was at the mall early because I was doing something else then she told me she was waiting in a restaurant. I quickly went there, and she was with her dad, mom and sister. They told me to have fun and left. We ordered and started talking for about an hour. It was great until her other friends arrived. We went to another restaurant to eat dessert. When we were leaving and this guy from the group of friends paid my dates bill then she hugged him. Honestly, the date went overall great but the last part.","Update on my date with my crush [Last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/jzwocu/i_know_no_one_cares_but/)

teenagers,I need some help,"This is a long story and idk how to explain it. So basically my friend(f14)  made a groupchat on ig and there was this guy ive never spoken to before. He dmed me and we started talking. at first everything seemed normal he was a chill guy but then he asked me to send him thigh pics at first i thought he was joking and brushed it off. After that everything went normal but then i stopped texting i ghosted him for 3 days and after that my friend who added him to the groupchat said that i should block him. so apperantly he was threatning my friend that he would share her thigh pics if she didnt send nudes. U might be wondering how he got thight pics, well she didnt send any he just had a pic of her in an outfit that showed her thights so my friend just blocked the guy and reported him i did too.

So today my sister walkes up to me and says that some random dude has been texting her and hes claming that my friend send him nudes which is a lie hes now texting other ppl that idk what elses hes going to do. My friend is really worried i blocked both of his acs and made my sister and my friend to post on thayr storys to block that guy idk what else i can do abt this so im asking for help.

teenagers,I need some help,"So my step sister (whose in the same grade and class as me) posted a very embarrassing thing on our class gc about some guy and I. I’m a very shy person it took my a long time to break out of my shell and now all that progress is ruined and I never want to open up to anyone ever again. After she posted the video I left the gc and asked her why she would do that and she kept saying “oh it was a joke” or “everyone’s taking it as a joke!” But should I think it’s a joke if everyone else is? She’s posted that without my knowing and my permission and after that all I did was ask her to respect that I want her to ask me but she laughed in my face. My stepdad confronted her and she said she was trying to understand what I was feeling but if she did she would have apologized and respected my boundaries, but she hasn’t. Now my little sister and her are acting like it’s my fault I’m mad at her and that I’m in the wrong and honestly they’ve convinced me that I am. Even though it’s only been three days the two nights after what happened I’ve been crying myself to sleep because of it, asking myself “why do I have to ruin everything?” They’re (my step and bio sister) are talking about me behind my back. I’ve been diagnosed with social anxiety and I’ve told them about it and how I’m very sensitive about people talking about me behind my back but they don’t care, they don’t care that they’re making me live my worse nightmare. I don’t want to go to school. I loved it at school because they had such a nice environment and I had friends there and now I don’t even want to step foot in there. The bad thing is is that she knows a lot of things about me that I wouldn’t tell anyone there because I had trusted her and opened up to her so I’m afraid that she’ll reveal those things too. It’s really hard for me to trust people because of events earlier in my life. The thing is I was definitely not in the right place before I met my step family but now I feel the exact same way, friendless and alone.","I need some help So my step sister (whose in the same grade and class as me) posted a very embarrassing thing on our class gc about some guy and I.

&amp;#x200B;

""Life... Life is not about the destination nor is it about the journey. It is about the people you meet on that journey. People you can call friends. People you can love. People that care about you"".

""Life is not a simple thing, and it will surprise you time and time again, whether those surprises are good or bad. Life will knock you down and force you up again. It plays with your feelings, your soul, tries to break it, shatters it and crushes your heart. Still you must stand up and take every single one of those blows. It hurts. Life will hurt you"".

""You will start asking yourself if any of that pain and suffering is worth it. What would happen if I just ended it all? Then you look around and see everyone, see everything. How could you leave them? How could you cause pain for them? So you stand up stronger than ever, taking every blow life throws your way, not looking back. You are now immune. You are immune because you understand"".

""That is when you will know that you have survived. That you are truly alive. And in the end of all things you ask was it worth it? Was all that hard work and pain worth it? You look around one last time. You see the people you love, the people who love you, the people you gathered on the way, on your journey. You see the light. So, was it worth it? A tear falls down on your cheek. Through your smile you can proudly say: Yes, yes it was worth it. You close your eyes one last time and your journey comes to an end"".

teenagers,Y’all seriously overthink talking to girls,"Stop basing love and romance off of media. Shit in real life is very different and it can be way easier than y’all think it is. I’ll try to part it out as best I can 

1) find a group of people that are like you 

2) there’s bound to be a couple girls that are in that group

3) MAKE CONNECTIONS, talk to people. Do not think at all. Thinking will be the end of, well everything.

4) once you have talked to everyone, or have even got a crush (this part is usually where everyone is) you have to stop thinking. Let go of all of your emotion and place your full interest into them (without being creepy) while still having a pre personality 

5) do not talk to them as a friend for too long, every now and then get a *tiny* but flirty and see if they reciprocate l

6) if they reciprocate after that then find the right time to shoot your shot.

Sarah Fuller became the first girl to kick in an NCAA at the Power-5 level! She had already won the National Championship in soccer was called on when Vanderbilt's kicker got hurt.

teenagers,"Guys, I need your help.","My parents keep on signing me up for stuff I don't want to do. It's aggravating, and just not right.

For example, recently, my mother signed me up to go and volunteer at a food bank, 3 weeks in advance, and she neglected to tell me until the night before. Don't get me wrong I would have said yes, but I had made plans with some friends about a week before on that day, with her approval. But what I am mostly here for is the fact that she signed me up for swimming. Of course, she didn't tell me and I had said before that I did not want to do swimming, but she signed me up anyway because ""You \[I\] need exercise "". This really annoyed me until I went to the doctor's office, and got a sports physical, and my weight to height ratio was completely normal (mind you this was about 2 days after I started a month session of swimming, so the swimming never actually took a part in any weight loss). In the past, my parents were worried about becoming overweight, and maybe that was why they signed me up in the first place, so that put my anger at them for signing me up for swimming a bit off, and I proceeded to tell them not to sign me up again, and a consensus with my mother and I about it. now i am in the last week of swimming, and guess what? They signed me up for the next session, without telling me again! I am really lost at this point and need some help on how i can get them to stop this BS.

teenagers,Self control,"So my girl friend has been in a relationship for 1.5 years, and there's this guy that has a crush on her, and he knows about it, and he knows that she knows, in his social media stories he always says he loves her and stuff, I can't even describe how uncomfortable she looks whenever the topic gets brought up, are people really this inconsiderate and idiotic?

teenagers,A rant about the United States (from someone that lives in the United States),"(This was from a comment I made on another post, but decided to put it here)  
Also, some of this is kinda my own opinion so uhhh yeah

I've lived in suburban in the states my entire life and the one thing that I have always noticed people mention or say that oh...

* We have freedom
* Guns
* That here, everything's... *normal?!?!*

It's really the last one that gets me. What's so normal about the United States? But more importantly, some people think that we have freedom and that we're normal, meaning, *they think freedom isn't normal when it actually is*.

The heart of this problem really comes down to our ridiculously stupid and flawed education system. I can guarantee that there's probably a stupid large percentage of people that think we're the only country on the damn earth, and it's mostly because of what they teach in the education system.

There's two main factors for it, the biggest being that the news and the media have a really changing impact on a lot of american's opinions. You see, I'm gonna take a guess that if you live in the EU, you probably hear a lot of *""normal""* news about other surrounding countries within the EU. However, in American news, they usually only focus on whatever bad events are happening in other countries, and that usually develops the assumption to most americans that we simply are just *normal,* because we don't have those things happen.

Well I can guarantee for a damn fact that we are *anything* but normal, and not in a good way.

* Rigged education system
* *Stupidly rigged* health care system that MAKES YOU PAY TO TAKE A FUCKING AMBULENCE
* Insanely unrestricted gun laws that give us the infamous cliche of school shootings
* WHY DO WE STILL USE THE FUCKING IMPERAL SYSTEM AND FARENHEIGHT?
* An unbelievably long history of systemic racism that has been completely ignored.

And it doesn't make us look any better when most of the self-entitled idiots here have just been listening to propaganda their whole life, and nobody takes any action against it.  
Like I could say...

""Hey, maybe if we improved our healthcare system, *maybe* we wouldn't be in dead fucking last place in healthcare quality""

""bUt I dOn'T wAnT tO pAy FoR sOmEoNe ElSe!!!111!!""

\---

""Hey, maybe if we had *sightly* better gun laws, *maybe* we wouldn't have five school shootings every *fucking* month.""

""nO gUnS aRe OuRs AnD nObOdY iS gOnNa TaKe ThEm FrOm Me!!111""

\--

""For gods sake, could you please just follow the COVID protocol and wear a freaking mask!!""

""nO, I dOn'T wAnNa, ThIs Is A vIoLaTiOn Of My FiRsT aMmEnDmEnT rIgHt!!!11""

Did you see the reoccurring problem? *Selfishness.* When the education system teaches us to a point that we think we are the *only* country with freedom, (which we aren't), people will believe it and use every opportunity to stomp it down on others. To act as if they are entitled to their every desire, because it's American, damn it!

I just had to let this out because I am so sick and tired of the idiots here that just refuse to accept the fact that other countries exist and that *maybe* they have some better governmental laws and ideas.

TL:DR, the reason why we have such entitled idiots is a mixture of propaganda from the news and the education system that makes some people believe we are the only country in the world with freedom","A rant about the United States (from someone that lives in the United States) (This was from a comment I made on another post, but decided to put it here)

Why do they not care about science?

teenagers,H0rny post,"Antlers are extensions of an animal's skull found in members of the deer family. Antlers are a single structure composed of bone, cartilage, fibrous tissue, skin, nerves, and blood vessels. They are generally found only on males, with the exception of the reindeer/caribou. Antlers are shed and regrown each year and function primarily as objects of sexual attraction and as weapons in fights between males for control of harems.

In contrast, horns, found on pronghorns and bovines such as sheep, goats, bison and cattle, are two-part structures. An interior of bone (also an extension of the skull) is covered by an exterior sheath made of keratin, the same material as human fingernails and toenails, grown by specialized hair follicles. Horns are never shed and continue to grow throughout the animal's life. The exception to this rule is the pronghorn which sheds and regrows its horn sheath each year. They usually grow in symmetrical pairs.","H0rny post Antlers are extensions of an animal's skull found in members of the deer family.

She gets along really well with others but me. Why? I've never, ever offended her in any way. Maybe I'm just not likeable?

teenagers,The best friend of the guy I am in love with just confessed his feelings to me and I don't know what to do,"So this is a long story and needs some background. Met this guy sophomore year of college and we started hooking up and I caught feelings he didn't - twas heartbreaking. Second semester comes around we somehow end up in the same seminar with the girl that he had feelings for the entirety of last semester, while we were hooking up. Of course like the idiots we are we start hooking up again second semester and the entire time I am telling myself its nothing I don't feel anything though I am clearly lying to myself - a fact I confronted when quarantine hit and we were all sent back home. Then i had the summer to get over him though I did see him a couple times, and again as the universe would have it, he moved into a apartment two blocks away from me for this year. So since August we have been hanging out and spending a lot of time together and its been fun because he truly is a good person and I do appreciate the friendship. Then of course we start hooking up again, but this time I know that I don't want a relationship. Quarantine did a number on my mental health so I was working on myself and healing myself. It was just for the fun and enjoyment, was also seeing other people. But the more time I spent with this guy the more I am like girl its so clear you aren't fully over him, like two dudes have asked you out and you are just like no I can't, but I know that if he were to I would jump on that immediately, but I know that he doesn't see me in that way, and I love him so much that I'd rather just have him in my life in the way he wants than to lose him at all. After having this realization I was like well ok, now I know this, and probably won't be able to enter a relationship as long as I am this close to him, but he is leaving in a couple months so once he leaves I can start over. I was totally ok with like putting my love life on pause for the next couple months, its already been on pause for the past year, and I told him this, twice. And he felt bad, but I was like hey I already didn't want a relationship and like this is just a smaller reason that adds to it. - this is all the background. 

Now the past month I have been hanging with him and his best friend and we have been getting along very great. Like every weekend I'll hang with them, hook up with the guy, his best friend would sleep in the guest room, we would wake up the next morning and go on a hike or explore a place. Like a lot of time together. Me and his best friend got along great! Like we bonded about so much and in my mind this is all platonic, he is well aware that I am hooking him with the guy. We both were really open about our mental health with each other and were like omg you get me, and that was like the first time someone understood the weird thoughts I have in my head, but again like in my mind this was all like wow he is such a great friend. It was brought up once with me and the guy, I was like ""wow me and your best friend are getting along so well, its wild I like really connect with him."" and his response was I can set you up and I was like ahahaha no that would be so weird think about the situation that would be so strange. Like maybe after you leave that could be a possibility but its way to strange. Me and the best friend still talk a lot and exchange music - but again in my mind its all platonic. Cut to last night when we were having a wine night and they came to pick me up. I am sitting in the passenger seat and the best friend is driving. We park the car and the guy who is in the backseat, just runs out of the car, and that is when I knew exactly what was going to happen and I was like oh no. OH NO. then for the next hour the best friend proceeds to be the sweetest and nicest person and open his heart up to me and I was like fuck how do I respond to this? At one point I literally start crying because in any other case I would have probably responded like yea lets try something out, but the situation is extremely strange, and this happened before the wine night so then after all this and me being like I need time, like I can't give you an answer now. Then the wine night happens I am pretty sure I had a acute anxiety attack the entire night, from like 1-4am I thought I was going to have a heart attack and it just panic just kept building but never reaching a point it was bad. Imagine being in a room with these two people after all this has happened, and now I feel like I probably just like messed up my friendship with both these dudes. I just don't know what to do and feel horrible right now.","The best friend of the guy I am in love with just confessed his feelings to me and I don't know what to do So this is a long story and needs some background.

teenagers,"Fellas, just a question","How do **you** help your friends? Or even just other people?

So, let me jump into the context. I want to become a better person and as a friend. Whenever somebody vents, I find it hard to respond and think of something to say. Once I do respond, I'm scared that I might've said something that might make them feel worse. My first instinct to a vent is to solve the issue if it's solvable, once I acknowledge their feelings. But I don't know if that's the right thing to do. Recently, my friend was venting then my other friend jumped right in a comforted them, making them feel better. I want to aim to become like that friend. Someone who responds well and shows that they really care.

I'm going to talk a lot, so if you don't want to hear some kid complain then go away, and for anyone sticking around this may take a while to read. I hate my body: I'm skinny (skinny enough that I have a visible hole in my chest), I'm short, I have spots, I shave, my face is oily and I sweat a lot. But I don't consider myself ugly, I'm just not as 'good looking' as I'd like. I'm shy. I'm not EXTREMELY shy, but I find it hard thinking of what to say to my friends. I'm germophobic; my hands look like I have eczema and that goes up to my wrists. I get cuts and once several deep cuts on my knuckles that took ages to heal. I wouldn't say I'm depressed, but there's times where I'll go under my bed cover and cry, which is infrequent, as I mostly just sit in my bed, or sit in class, feeling numb. I feel numb now. I haven't actually cried in ages. I just feel numb. Alternatively I'll be happy and laugh. I never used to laugh, but I do now because I just don't care. I don't try at school. I used to be naughty but no longer am because for some fucking reason I became shy so now I'm reserved and keep to myself. Also, I struggle with my sexuality. I think I'm gay, but because of the numbness I just don't feel aroused by anyone. The only reason I still think I'm gay is because when I wank I imagine having sex with the same sex. For me life is a chore. I have a daily routine that even if I'm a minute off from doing something my day is ruined. My only shave is watching movies, which I'm passionate about. I feel like I still have things to say, but I'm gonna stop soon. That's another thing: my mind is full of traffic. I can't get everything down because several ideas are forming in my head and I can't find the words to get there and by that point I forget what I was going to say. I’ve wanted to do a post like this for ages but haven't had the motivation. I don't even know what I want to get out of this. I don't know what to say.","I can't see I'm sat under my bed with my glasses off writing this with bold, enlarged text and the brightness up. I hate wearing glasses.

I want to study psychology when I'll go to University.
The games that I enjoy currently (and that are multi-player) are Valorant, Risk Of Rain 2 and Minecraft.

teenagers,That person next door might be more depressed than you think,"Just wanted to remind you all to maybe spread a little love when seeing your neighbor or at least not be rude.

teenagers,u/NatsukiFan,"People of Reddit, I come seeking your help.

I had a friend called r/NatsukiFan on Reddit, and we had this thing where we would chat everyday, and honestly this dude made me feel better about shit and I hope I made him feel a little bit better too.

Now recently, my mother decided to take my electronics away because my self harm was getting bad again, so I couldn't go onto Reddit and chat with him. 

I'm fucking worried sick. The account has been deactivated, none of the messages are getting through, and I don't mean to share his personal information to the world, but he was suicidal.

I don't know whether his account got deleted or anything, but he last commented 17 hours ago, I don't know whether he is attempting suicide right now or whether he has possibly blocked me because I hadn't replied in over two weeks. I don't know.

But I am practically begging you, please share this post whatever, just help my find my friend again","u/NatsukiFan People of Reddit, I come seeking your help.

teenagers,I have a Dr Pepper addiction,"TL;DR Dumbass drunk 33990ml of Dr Pepper and is telling you for some reason.  


For the past few months I've been collecting **Dr Pepper bottles and cans after drinking them** and have drunk about **33990ml of Dr Pepper.** I'm also drinking one while writing this post. Well anyways, that would mean if you use the cans as a measurement **(330ml)** for how much I have drunk it would be **103 cans**, I just think that's a little bit cool and a lot very insane. Sadly I was just forced to get rid of them all and I wanted to make this post as a remembrance for all of the Dr Pepper, they will be missed.

teenagers,I don't know if I should tell someone I still like them,"Here's a little context: A girl and I were in an online relationship a while back (approx. a year ago) because I'm not allowed to date irl. We ended up breaking up because she started liking someone she knew in person and wanted to pursue a relationship with them. I told her it was fine and that it's understandable because I can't really be there for her as well as he can for obvious reasons. We ended on great terms and I basically just let her go cause I just wanted her to be happy. 

After the breakup, we were good friends for a while but stopped talking for some time because of school. Recently we started talking, playing games, and calling again and all my feelings for her came rushing back. Every now and then I get the urge to tell her how I feel, but I don't know how things will end up turning out. I've asked a couple of friends what I should do about the situation but they've all replied in a similar manner with ""an ex is an ex for a reason."" They can't seem to comprehend that nothing bad actually happened between me and the girl. 

I honestly don't know what I expect from the situation. I just wanted to see what some of you thought about it and what you recommend I do.","I don't know if I should tell someone I still like them Here's a little context: A girl and I were in an online relationship a while back (approx. a year ago) because I'm not allowed to date irl.

teenagers,Alright this needs to be said. Just. Because. Someone. Is. Skinny. That. Doesn’t. Mean. They. Are. Healthy.,"Because of the mindset that being fat is ugly and skinny is attractive you have tons and tons of people (mostly girls.) starving themselves to look ideal to others. They develop a lot of eating disorders because they have a lot of pressure out on them because of it.

You’re chubby? Lose some weight, men don’t like fat women.
 
You’re skinny? Gain some weight, men won’t like you if you’re just skin and bones.

It’s always something, there’s always a problem being pushed onto people, PEOPLE ARE FUCKING STARVING THEMSELVES JUST TO BE TREATED EQUALLY TO EVERYONE ELSE. 

There is tons and tons of stories where girls say that after they starved themselves and looked skinny they got compliments and told by their own fucking family “oh you look much healthier.” Sometimes they will even say to their family that they starved themselves and those pieces of shit will be like “good,” because they are now skinny.

People have eating disorders and die form them because of this fucked up mindset.

WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE?!

So please, don’t shame people for being chubby, unless they are unhealthy and obese then I understand but instead of insulting you can ignore them or try to help. 

Same goes when it comes to skinny people, don’t insult them and make fun of them. Try to help.","Alright this needs to be said. Just. Because. Someone. Is. Skinny. That. Doesn’t. Mean. They. Are.

teenagers,I need some help,"Ill start at the beginning. Freshman year i met a Japanese girl (well call her Ue) and we instantly became friends. After a couple months we started dating. She left in may, 2019, and we kept up a long distance relationship that actually worked fairly well. The problems started when she started going to driving school. Before this period, wed had an argument maybe once a month, but we would always put it behind us and let it go. We knew that long distance would never be easy, but when she started having to learn to drive as well as study for college, she got a lot more stressed. I had also been getting up at 5:00 every morning and staying up till 11:00 every night so that we could talk. And so eventually, I decided i needed to take a week sleeping normally. The problem came when that week turned into two turned into three. I was trying to start getting up early again, but it wasn’t working. Due to this, and her being busy with studies, tension between us grew. Then, after a year and a half of dating, a full year of long distance, it broke.

I went to a friends house without telling her. Id known this person for years, since 8th grade (and it was my the summer before my Jr year now). But none of that mattered. The friend i went to see was a girl. Obviously it looks bad, and of course it looked like i was cheating. How could it not? But the reality was, i just wanted to see a friend. I didn’t keep where i was a secret, although my phone didn’t have service at her house. But i’m not asking how to fix the relationship. I’m afraid that, although i hate to admit it, its permanently broken. 

I’m asking how you guys move on. She haunts my dreams and sticks in my mind when i’m alone. She’s all i can think about at night and during my nightly drive home. Ive talked to her, and she wants me to move on. If its all i can do for her now, then its what i want to do too. All advice is welcome, and thanks for reading.","I need some help Ill start at the beginning. Freshman year i met a Japanese girl (well call her Ue) and we instantly became friends. After a couple months we started dating. She left in may, 2019, and we kept up a long distance relationship that actually worked fairly well. The problems started when she started going to driving school. Before this period, wed had an argument maybe once a month, but we would always put it behind us and let it go. We knew that long distance would never be easy, but when she started having to learn to drive as well as study for college, she got a lot more stressed. I had also been getting up at 5:00 every morning and staying up till 11:00 every night so that we could talk. And so eventually, I decided i needed to take a week sleeping normally. The problem came when that week turned into two turned into three. I was trying to start getting up early again, but it wasn’t working. Due to this, and her being busy with studies, tension between us grew. Then, after a year and a half of dating, a full year of long distance, it broke.

I went to a friends house without telling her. Id known this person for years, since 8th grade (and it was my the summer before my Jr year now). But none of that mattered. The friend i went to see was a girl. Obviously it looks bad, and of course it looked like i was cheating. How could it not? But the reality was, i just wanted to see a friend. I didn’t keep where i was a secret, although my phone didn’t have service at her house. But i’m not asking how to fix the relationship. I’m afraid that, although i hate to admit it, its permanently broken. 

I’m asking how you guys move on. She haunts my dreams and sticks in my mind when i’m alone. She’s all i can think about at night and during my nightly drive home.

teenagers,"I thought of this game idea, its gonna be called The Most Realistic Shooter","Okay so make this the HARDEST GAME EVER. Borderline impossible, a button you have to  press to breathe a button for each part of your body ex. arms and legs. TMRS, the hardest game ever made and its gonna have a story line and everything. Now here's the catch, the game is gonna be an absurd 100 dollars. But now you must ask, but leaf no one gonna buy a 100 dollar game and you'd be right BUT put a 10,000 dollar prize onto the first person to beat the game with no cheats and exploits and has to stream the whole thing. Now you got a different story. Make this game LONG, excruciatingly long. HOURS of gameplay BUT with only 5 lives. 5 lives for the WHOLE game, die 5 times and your now not worthy of that 10,000. Every time you die, you restart from all the way in the beginning, no check points. You get shot in the head, you're dead. You get shot in the leg or arms you are alive but ur gonna be slow and have HORRIBLE aim. 

try and get a famous YouTuber that has both the talent and perseverance to do this. Get them to play this game and try it, give this attention. TELL PEOPLE BOUT THAT 10,000 DOLLAR PRIZE. That is ur marketing. 

If someone can deadass make this, that would be awesome.","I thought of this game idea, its gonna be called The Most Realistic Shooter Okay so make this the HARDEST GAME EVER.

teenagers,"When you hurt someone *advice""","It's been one year or more but it feels like yesterday when I messed up my beautiful relationship and hurted the guy who loved me so selflessly. 

I remember feeling lost without him as he turned to leave. As he was breaking up with me. I remember how I wanted to die on the spot. To not want to live even a second in which ik he isn't mine anymore and I am not his anymore.

And I cried. I cried hard.  I slapped myself hard for messing up the relationship with a guy I love so god damn much.

No I didn't cheat , please don't hate me. But I did lie to him about some major things which he should have known.

I hid because I was afraid of how he would react but that day I realised if I had told him when it was needed to be told nothing of this sort would be happening. He would have been mad maybe but he would have been okay within two to three days.

I remember his phone call in which he said ""I spit on your love""

I remember him consoling me at night. I remember him and I crying together. He couldn't leave me as he said ""I just love you too much to leave. If there's any try again then it's with you. I don't want to go and try with anyone else.""

He gave us another chance. And I am glad he did. 

I know many of you reading this must love your partners more than life itself but maybe been neglecting to tell something to your partner which you know you should tell but think it's small and it shouldn't really be told.

Please go tell that to them. Love them each and every single day as hard as possible and always think how they would feel before you do something.

If you have a partner so full of love please never hurt them . Please be careful

teenagers,Stuff's not going well rn,"I've been spent my 19 hours being awake doing my homeworks and tasks everyday working my ass off for school

One tasks that involved editing was to make a poem and record it, I spent a lot of time writing the crappy ass poem and recording it and I thought I was done with it so I move in the the next

I still have 6 tasks to do, 3 requiring video/sound editing. And apparently I wasn't finished the poem thing yet as apparently that also needed to be a ""Music video"" and I'm currently in my grandpa's house and will have to resort to using my phone to make the ""music video"" but I still have other tasks to do so I decide to start then

I currently have only my crappy laptop with me so I decide to make our other activy which is creating a storyboard and then...

Boom, laptop fking dies, I've tried everything, opened it up cleaned it nothing, it smelled burnt, my 9 year old laptop finally gave up, now wtf am I gonna use for online class. And I am also how unable to do my 3rd editing tasks which was an infomercial for earthquakes.

Yabai, shit I still have so much to do and I needed that laptop, I'll now only be able to do those tasks when I get home so I do my worksheets on google classroom and oh shit, I missed the deadline of one of the activities by 2 hours, the Google form for the submission is now closed I'm basically fked.

Ok I'll do the other activities, I do the other 2 successfully and I've completed 2/8 tasks, and missed one, did one wrong and I am unable to do the other 2 because laptop is dead.

teenagers,My dad set parental control on my laptop and I feel really uncomfortable,"Screen limit at 10PM daily, search history can be viewed, some websites blocked. I'm not sure if I'm just overreacting but I feel frustrated. 
Ever since we had a new PC, my dad gave it a screen limit, and since it's a family PC, I agreed. But what he didn't tell me is that he will only be setting a screen limit on all of my accounts connected. That includes my PC account and my laptop. It's irritating that only I am affected.

When I confronted my dad about it he just said ""just wake up at 6 am"", and it's easier said than fucking done. I told him that I find it really hard to instantly adjust and he just told me to suck it up because the world doesnt revolve around me. Arguing with him would be pointless. So I just tried to suck it up.
Then I realized, website blocking was on. I couldn't even get on reddit (Using mobile to write this). I'm not some naive preteen on the internet I'm fucking 15. I contemplated about deleting the app because I feel uncomfortable with it but it will only notify my dad. I don't want to talk to him or confront about anything. I also thought about creating a different account on my laptop, it's too slow to set everything up. My other option kinda makes me feel satisfied just thinking about it. I could do really well on my studies and prove them wrong and earn it back (I still wouldn't talk to him though lol). Is it weird that I find it satisfying to prove someone wrong? Because ever since high school started they've all branded me as lazy and disappointing. I'd like to prove them wrong and be able to play whenever I want. 

This only happened because of my fucked up sleep schedule, and I guess I deserve this. But I still feel uncomfortable. Now that I'm actually trying hard on my studies  My laptop is my comfort zone and I feel at peace whenever I play minecraft. Now that comfort is gone and I hate it. I'm pissed. Especially because my laptop is affected. It's my personal goddamn laptop. I feel really uncomfortable. 

I'm just rambling at this point, I apologize for the shitty format and stuff.

teenagers,My sister has her douchebag boyfriend over,"TL;DR sister makes me bend over back for her while I can't hangout with anyone but she can do whatever she wants.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister decided she wanted to hang out with her boyfriend today, well guess who had to clean the house up for her? Me.

I'm not allowed to have female friends over because ""I might get one pregnant"" while if my sister fucked him right in front of my parents they wouldn't care.

People wonder why I always want to cuddle but that's because my parents don't let me. I can't hang out with friends, they can't hangout with me. 

I'm done, sure I can drive but they put a tracker on my phone now so everywhere i go, they can find me, what makes it worse is if I have a female friend, they don't want me hanging out with them, ever.

So I'm stuck here not allowed to leave my room until my sister's boyfriend leaves just because my sister doesn't want me to show my face around him

Fuck this, 1 more year to go and they won't see me ever again.","My sister has her douchebag boyfriend over TL;DR sister makes me bend over back for her while I can't hangout with anyone but she can do whatever she wants.

teenagers,I'm so excited to be a boyfriend / husband someday,"I'm a 17 year old male from the United States.  Growing up I have never really fit into the stereotypical mold of a teenage guy.  I don't care about sports, and I have a lot of thought patterns that are much more like those like the ones girls/women typically have, mostly that I am an extremely relationally-oriented person rather than task / productivity oriented.  

I wouldn't say that I felt self conscious about these things, but I do think they subconsciously were sending messages that I would have a hard time finding a girlfriend, or something. Idk.  Anyway, at one point I had a somewhat unfounded fear that finding a girlfriend would be hard, or impossible.

But in the past few months I've been able to break that thought pattern.

I am regular platonic friends with a lot of girls (I find the average high school age girl far easier to be friends with than the average high school age guy, because at least where I am the average high school age guys are all absolute boneheads and some of them are just jerks) and as I've become closer with a few of these people it's become clear that there's a lot more to like in me than I originally thought.

I've been growing my hair out for most of this year, and I was finally able to tie a good amount of it back (check my profile if you want to see a pic) and one friend of mine, who I will give the pseudonym Jules as I'll be mentioning her a good amount, told me she thought it looked pretty good.  Now, when it comes to relationships of any kind, looks are just about the least important thing, but it felt really good to get that compliment, especially coming from a girl.

Now Jules and I have been very close for almost 4 years, and we have a very close friendship and we can talk about pretty much anything.  While she and I could almost certainly have an amazing romantic relationship, we're just regular friends at the moment.  Jules is one of those people who just radiate happiness everywhere they go and she's often the person I go to when I need an emotional boost.  One day after she sent me a bunch of uplifting and cheerful stuff on Snapchat, I said something along the lines of ""Thank you for being there for me, I really needed it.  Thanks for being such a kind and loving person.""  She replied with something like ""aww, thanks.  I can honestly say that you are the sweetest person I know."" and it made me feel even better.  

Other people close to me have told me similar things.  In addition to the hair, I've had a girl recently tell me that she loves the way my voice sounds, especially the way it gets a little bit raspy when I talk extremely quietly.

In general, it's things about myself that I've kinda taken for granted (not so much the hair, but everything else) and it is good to know that I have things about me that girls find attractive.

But at the same time, I am equally excited to be able to pour love and affection into them.  I'm a loving and caring person and touch is my top love language, so being able to give this girl hugs, kisses and general cuddles would be simply amazing for me, and this is not even considering the more passionate cuddles those relationships tend to involve.  Kind words are another big one for me... being able to comfort, compliment, and flirt with my significant other will be an amazing thing as well.

At the moment, I""m choosing to stay single because I will be moving out of my home soon and I don't want to start anything that will probably end up being broken off.  But I am so excited to be a rock-solid boyfriend, and eventually, husband, to a fantastic lady out there who I probably haven't even met yet.","I'm so excited to be a boyfriend / husband someday I'm a 17 year old male from the United States.

And the problem is that she is just friendly some times and it's really hard to determine friendship from crushing.

teenagers,How do I handle my 14-year-old son who just assaulted me?,"When my daughter was 18, she slapped me on my face. I stood there with my mouth open in astonishment. I said I can't believe you hit me. There are many details to this story about the whys of not putting her out. She had pent up resentment toward me from leaving her so much and for long periods of time while I would be deployed. I had served in the Army. She tried to hit me again a couple of months later. I moved out of the way and gave her a slight push in the direction that she was lunging with her swing. She fell down. I called the police. I asked them to explain to her what could be done about it, should I choose and not limited to putting her on the street. I asked them to explain to her that she doesn't have to love or even like me but that she will give me respect. A couple months passed and she really attacked me. I beat the brakes off her. I had my limit. I had beat myself up enough over having left her so much. I was not going to suffer abuse from her or myself any more. It devised me to do that. At 21 yrs older than her, I am still stronger and more skilled at fighting, (soldier, kickboxer, martial artist...really kind of stupid on her part.) I have never been abusive to my daughter. I was creative with punishments as she grew up. I would make her do push ups, clean something, or remove electronics or other privileges. I did not want it to come to that, a physical altercation. I didn't want to take legal action or put her on the street either. This seemed like the only option. Guess what?? She has never attacked me physically or verbally again. She is respectful to me and we get along great now. She moved out a couple yrs later and maybe it is bc she grew up that she stated behaving better. Idk really for sure why but it is great now. This isn't the answer for everyone but it worked for me. Thank God that I do not have a large son. I am 5'3"" tall and 130 lbs.","How do I handle my 14-year-old son who just assaulted me?

I told him that every time I had gone into his room to bring him a coffee (I have to make and bring him a coffee at certain times during the day or he’ll complain) he had been on his Xbox. He responded to this by turning off my Xbox and  saying that if the living room was tidier he would want to spend time down here with everyone. I spent the next few minutes tidying only to find that he’d been going through my room to find something to moan at me about.

Despite having tidied up everything he is still spending his weekend staying upstairs only to moan if I do that.

teenagers,"Girl trouble, as usual","Ok, so I’ve liked this girl for a year. About a month ago, I told her how I felt. She said she liked me too. Then, the next day, I asked her out. She said yes, but then the day after that, she said she wasn’t allowed to date. Now, I actually believe this, cuz I know her parents. Her dad is pretty chill and wouldn’t care, but her mom would freak out. It’s been about a month, and literally nothing has happened. About 2 weeks ago, she got my number, so we talked a little, but that’s about it. I’m thinking I should let it just fade away, like it never happened. Partially cuz I’m kinda scared, but also bc it’s getting rly uncomfortable to talk to her.","Girl trouble, as usual Ok, so I’ve liked this girl for a year. About a month ago, I told her how I felt.

teenagers,I bumped into my childhood Bully today.,"Well, i just wanna take it out my system, so, when I went to what In the US would be middle school, a new girl had entered the school, whom we'll call ""Fiona"" she was an scandalous girl, but nothing too bad, right?
So, i had two friends from kindergarten and one from the last year of elementary, we weren't exactly best friends, but we were kinda close, the kind of friends that always do the group projects togheter and work well.
One day, we saw Fiona alone, and we felt bad, so i suggested we went to ask her if she wanted to be with us, my friends agreed, so we went, she was really excited about the idea, so she started hanging out with us more often.
But she always was kind of mean to me, but I thought nothing of it, i just said ""Maybe she still needs to gain confidence in me too"" and shrugged it off.
Then, one day I couldn't go to school since i had the flu, it was really minor so the next day I was able to go, but...Some people from my class were looking weirdly at me.
I was confused, but then i reached my friends, and they gave me an annoyed look, i asked what was wrong, and they said ""Fiona told us you made her get the flu"" and i was confused, but still apologized and promised I would apologize to her as soon as she came back, the next three days i actually felt better, my friend group felt more calm without her, but still felt something missing after two months of hanging with her.
Then on Monday we had a small play performed by teachers about recycling, and i was on the last rows although I was one of the smallest of i dare say the whole class, being only 150 centimeters tall.

Then, Fiona faked falling to the floor, and cried ""OP THREW ME TO THE FLOOR"" And i was like ""No! I didn't!"" Some teachers came around, gave me a small warning, but then left me alone.
Then, after the show, i wanted to go with my friends, but I found Fiona crying with them, one said ""It was not nice of you doing that"" and didn't let me sit with them at lunch.
I thought it would be back to normal after a few days, but I was wrong, turns out Fiona started spreading rumours, she went with me to roller skating group, and i was skating kinda close to her, then, she fell to the floor, and started crying, the teacher confirmed it was not my fault, and everything continued as usual, but the next day, everyone started calling me a bully, turns out Fiona broke her wrist when she fell, and told everyone i had pushed her.
Accusations of other things continued during those years, i was left alone, nobody wanted to speak with me, i was looked down at, insulted, nobody wanted me in their group projects, and even Fiona started pushing me and cutting clips of my hair if i happened to sit in front of her.
The teachers did NOTHING.

Until, for high school, she changed schools following one of my former friends, that was the last i heard of her, and i was kinda able to clear my name, i was still alone, but at least I was just a wallflower now and not simply an outcast.

But today I was shopping for groceries, when I bumped into someone, i watched to apologise and saw her, Fiona.

I just muttered ""Sorry"" and left running to another aisle.

Honestly, i was shocked, in a bad way, i didn't really need to remember all that, i just shopped for everything I needed and left the store as quickly as I could.","I bumped into my childhood Bully today.

Then, Fiona faked falling to the floor, and cried ""OP THREW ME TO THE FLOOR"" And i was like ""No! I didn't!"" Some teachers came around, gave me a small warning, but then left me alone.
Then, after the show, i wanted to go with my friends, but I found Fiona crying with them, one said ""It was not nice of you doing that"" and didn't let me sit with them at lunch.
I thought it would be back to normal after a few days, but I was wrong, turns out Fiona started spreading rumours, she went with me to roller skating group, and i was skating kinda close to her, then, she fell to the floor, and started crying, the teacher confirmed it was not my fault, and everything continued as usual, but the next day, everyone started calling me a bully, turns out Fiona broke her wrist when she fell, and told everyone i had pushed her.
Accusations of other things continued during those years, i was left alone, nobody wanted to speak with me, i was looked down at, insulted, nobody wanted me in their group projects, and even Fiona started pushing me and cutting clips of my hair if i happened to sit in front of her.
The teachers did NOTHING.

Until, for high school, she changed schools following one of my former friends, that was the last i heard of her, and i was kinda able to clear my name, i was still alone, but at least I was just a wallflower now and not simply an outcast.

But today I was shopping for groceries, when I bumped into someone, i watched to apologise and saw her, Fiona.

I just muttered ""Sorry"" and left running to another aisle.

Honestly, i was shocked, in a bad way, i didn't really need to remember all that, i just shopped for everything I needed and left the store as quickly as I could."

teenagers,This sucks,"So basically, I’m in the 7th grade rn. I had this gf, but I broke up with her. Even after that, we remained rly good friends. We had even talked about getting back together a few times. So she was playing a prank on me, pretending to be suicidal, and I spent 8 hours strait trying to comfort her. Apparently, one girl found out and told the principal of my school. Now, she has external PE, so she goes home instead of going to 8th period. I was called to the office, and questions for around 1 1/2 hours. Then I heard the police say they were going to her house, and my heart stopped. Eventually, everything *kinda* worked out. The thing is, everything me and that girl had together is gone. We were close enough to be family, and this thing ruined all of it. We aren’t allowed to talk, she was offered a restraining order on ME, and it’s just ruined everything. I just thought this kinda belonged here","This sucks So basically, I’m in the 7th grade rn.

teenagers,What excuse can I give for spending $150?,"If there’s a reason I’ve been doing part time jobs, it’s because I wanted to cosplay, but didn’t have the money to do so as most of the money in my bank account was given to me by my aunt, and it’s meant for learning driving.  
  
But now that I have the money to cosplay, it’s just a matter of getting past my parents.  The problem is that the last part of my cosplay is a mask, something like a mascot head which costs about $150 as its custom made.  
  
The dress, boots and satin gloves were pretty cheap, so small amounts being deducted from my bank account could be easily passed off as me buying food or some in game currency.  
But for the mask, I know my parents will get suspicious once they see such a huge amount of money being deducted. And I don’t want another lecture from them on wasting money.  
 
What solid excuses can I give them if they ask me why there’s such a huge drop?","What excuse can I give for spending $150?

teenagers,"So um, I kinda want to vent about life I guess","Ah,  so I saw this post on another subreddit and it asked: ""can I ask what makes you smile?"" Or something along those lines. It really made me think for about 10 minutes what actually makes me smile. I realized that I smile just for the sake of it. The only genuine thing that makes me smile is the fact that I might meet someone, and I'd actually mean something to them, and that I might be able to make them smile. Apart from that, life does hate us.


     ""We're doing this because it's good for you"" ha. The same generic sentence. My father claims to know what's good for me, my grandmother claims to know what's good for me, they all claim to know what's good for me. I told them I don't want to become a doctor because I'm scared of blood, sure I know that there are other medical field to chose where I don't have to see blood, but being responsible of someone's health and maybe life is not possible for me as it's already hard for me to take care of my own life. When I told my parents I'm afraid of blood they gave me a 'that's stupid' laugh. They told me that it doesn't matter and that it's just something small and that I'll get over it before I'm 15. 
     

     Art, yes, I love to draw and I love to write stories, I do plan on creating a comic though. But my parents tell me to stop drawing and to study more often, that drawing will never help me to get a job or something. I want to draw, I love drawing. I tried asking for a drawing tablet but my parents tell me that I should study and not just draw all the time. I want to write stories, but telling them I'd want to do that as a job would result into me getting shouted at.


     I want to just . . . I don't know, it's fustrating, maybe just disappear? And what about that one person I might meet one day and make them happy? If I disappeared now, what would happen to them? I guess you could say I do believe in the soulmate thingy. I'm actually writing a story on it. I had no idea how much it reflects me ""I just want to find my soulmate and tell them sorry"" the character says. I honestly feel a lot like them for some reason. 

     
     What do I want to do when I grow up? I honestly have no idea. When I say I want to become something like a writer for example, he gives me this disappointed look and I quickly say ""I'm still thinking, I'm not sure"" that's what I try to say, but that's what I want to become. I'm honestly tired of him. He probably wants me to just become super p successful and earn a lot of money so that he can retire.


     I try not to think negatively about life but it does come back every once in a while. I dunno for how long I'd rather stay than disappear into thin air. Thanks for reading though.

teenagers,Fuck birds,"For fuck sake, let me sleep. Those fuckers keep screaming early in the morning. Normally when a squirrel does it outside my window, it's close enough for me to shoot it with a nerf gun to get it to stop. But of course, these flying alarm clocks are high enough in the trees to be out of range. Can genetic engineering come sooner so we can revoke their singing privileges?","Fuck birds For fuck sake, let me sleep. Those fuckers keep screaming early in the morning.

teenagers,Why does she hate me?,"So my boyfriend, m20, has been living at his uni house since September. In October I, f18, had a week off so went down to visit him for the first time. He introduced me to all his house mates when we saw them. He lives with mostly boys and 2 girls. One of the girls, f19 - let's call her D, saw me with him, he introduced us and we both said ""hi nice to meet you"" to each other. Everything seemed fine. However, on the second night they were being loud at 3am and my boyfriend asked them to be a bit quieter as it woke us both up. One of the boys came and apologised to us both the next day. The girl, D, saw us and goes ""sorry for waking you up *boyfriend's name*"" she blanked me.
Then when he went to uni a day or so later, I went downstairs to the kitchen, I saw D and said ""Hi"" to her. She looked at me and blanked me.
One day I was washing up and she came down and I accidentally got in her way and apologised. She ignored me.
Another time, me and my boyfriend were in the kitchen and she came down naked, just in a robe.

I don't know why she doesn't acknowledge me? I've been saying Hi to her and being polite. I think my boyfriend and her are different people, so there's nothing to worry about there, it's just really awkward and makes me not want to visit him again.

She would speak to some of the girlfriends of some of the boys, but they're older than her.","Why does she hate me? So my boyfriend, m20, has been living at his uni house since September.

teenagers,Hey so like ummmm life's stressful. I need help finding perspective (rant),"I'm 17. I'm about to graduate high school. I'm applying to college. I'm about to be an adult, and like what the FUUUUUCK is happening.

Assuming I get into college, there's 100 things that I need to stress about. How do I share a bathroom? I'm an only child, never have done that. How do I eat in a cafeteria? I don't eat at school, I study in the library during lunch and eat at home lol. How do I live on my own? I know how to do laundry and cook and stuff, but I don't like being alone.

Also!!! I love my house. It's the perfect size, and I have a yard and stuff. I don't wanna leave. 

I just need to find perspective, right? I kind of like the idea of having my own apartment. Yes, it's smaller than a house (duh), but it's all mine. 

The more I grow older, the more I realize that I do NOT wanna move far away from my parents. I'm a coddled only child who's had life handed easy to me.

I'm going to be honest and say that I'm privileged. My family is healthily middle class. My parents are (going to try) to pay for as much as my tertiary education as they can. They said I could live at home as long as I want until I'm able to start a stable life.

It's just I'm so stressed. What if I never get a good paying job? What if I can't live on my own. What if I never buy a house or get a good apartment. What if I become homeless or something. How do I share a bathroom if I get into college :(

teenagers,Am i wrong?,"Okay.... first of all, do you remember me? I am the suit man

So my sister's marriage is quite soon (less than a month) so i have to get a suit or something so while walking around in the mall with my mother and I saw a shop that sells suits i went in and i tried some stuff i didn't buy Anything i was just trying stuff and it was pretty nice to wear a suit for the first time and i really liked them (and there were sales for black Friday duh)

So that night i had to study for an exam i was going to re-take because I failed it (chemstry) it was a long day for me in the mall and stuff. So i was quite sleepy and while studying i was sleepy 

Cut to 3 or 4 hours later  i am just dying to sleep  bla bla bla i went to sleep then i hear the door opening and the lights were turned on and my mother was screaming at me for not studying. This is all i can say really because for the life of me i don't remember a single word she said

I was that sleepy to the point that her screams i couldn't hear (my mother is quite loud) anyway she leaves and says ""you find this to be okay you sleeping and me getting angry"" thank God she turns off the light afterwards after she left bla bla obviously couldn't sleep immediately because she was screaming and bla bla &gt;!wished to die but it didn't work (duh) (please don't talk about it, i don't care at all about it i am talking about this story i am telling rn. Don't tell me i should call someone or whatever. I won't)!&lt; and bla bla

I sleep, my mother wakes me up, she seems calm. Bla bla i have to leave for a class i have she gets me there in the way there we talk like there is no problem at all so i mentioned how i need to buy my suit before the sales end. That's when she gets angry again and brings up what had happened the day before and gets mad that my head isn't in the right place (it's in suits and saving money instead of a useless exam that i will get nothing from by the end of the year) (oh btw i would like to remind you that it's not me who wants the suit. It's my mother. For me i wish i went to the marriage in my red t-shirt and jeans but they told me i can't) and she gets mad so i mentioned how i don't want the suit anyway and i don't even want to go to my sister's marriage because it is going to be bad and how i am thinking about the sales that will end. She still continues to get mad so i just stop talking and hear her ramble for a while

Next day aka today i hear her talking about how we are going to miss out the sales if i don't buy today and when i wake up and ask her where she is going she says she is going to buy me a suit (we already know the size and stuff) so when i asked about what happened the day before and how my mind is in the wrong place she got angry again i am quite pissed they're going to buy my first suit ever without me but i am more pissed that i was right at the start when i was asking about the sales and stuff

i’ve found myself a darling man from Britain who has grown to love me, he supports me in my fluidity and enjoys all my little ticks and quirks. i’m scared to lose him after the fall and i’m terrified to learn what will happen when i tell him i’m schizophrenic. does anyone have any advice? and i’m sorry for the long post or if this isn’t the right place to ask","i’m anxious about what happens after the “fall” part of falling in love a bit of backstory: hi i’m gender fluid and pansexual, i date pretty much whoever and people tend to fall in love with me a lot and i have never quite understood why. though out of the twenty or so people who have told me they love me, i’ve only been the first to say it once.

What happened is one of my closest friends' college already started while I am waiting for mine to start.

I just behaved like an asshole and could not really fathom the amount the pressure she is going through or the amount of work she has to complete before deadline. So I started blaming her like she was lying to me and ignoring me. We used talk A LOT but she is not even getting time to talk her own twin brother, let alone talk to me. It's been nearly 5 days and I kept behaving like a weirdo (""creep"" as quoted by her) until I understood the depth of the situation today, when she broke up while saying how can I accuse her of ignoring and lying to me while not understanding her situation even if she considers me her closest friend. I told her sorry but got too apologetic (like I said sorry 10 times in one conversation) and again started behaving like a weirdo. I really fucked up and today was the climax 🤦‍♂️😞. I also got into few arguments, considering she has been mad on me for 5 days, the arguments might have been worse for her than I imagine. I don't want to lose a friend. Anyone's views r welcome.

teenagers,"My crush has a boyfriend, and I feel bad about lying to her but I’m not sure I have a choice","(TL;DR at the end)

(I’m a girl) 

I’ve been homeschooled for 8th, 9th, and this year, 10th grade. I was too afraid no one cared about me when I left school that I barely ever talked to anyone again, and even more rare that I saw them in person. There was this one girl that I always liked and probably always had a crush on. For the last few years we’ve texted pretty often. We kept making plans to visit each other but it never happened, it probably doesn’t help that she lives about 20 minutes away. Now with quarantine I know there’s no chance of seeing people in person for a while now. 

We usually text about not very deep stuff, like stories I wrote, songs we like, and we share our drawings. We only texted, for years, no phone calls or video chatting. We used to see each other in person one or two times a week at an after school thing. I quit that the same time I became homeschooled. We live in different school districts and never went to the same school. 

Yesterday, we were texting and for some reason I asked if she’d ever been kissed. She said she had, and that she already had two boyfriends. Her current one has been with her for almost a year now. She really likes him. 

I had one girlfriend before (I guess?) but I’m not sure if it counts. We “dated” for 5 months and broke up in the summer after 7th grade. We never kissed (we were 13) but we held hands a lot and slept in the same bed at sleepovers. We started “dating” because one day we found out we both had crushes on each other. Wow! Dream come true! What’s next? Dating, I guess. What does dating mean? I dunno, I just turned 13. 

Last night I was texting the girl I have a crush on, and I brought up that I was sad that I’ve never been kissed, and that I’d probably never find anyone to date soon anyway (because I’m homeschooled and never see anyone). My friend said I could join her friend group and meet people at her school. She put me on a group chat with one of her friends. Then we video called. We talked for an hour then her friend had to leave. The two of us continued talking for another 3 hours. We vented about anything and everything that was on our minds. 

I learned some interesting things about her. I was pretty sure she was straight, but she knows a lot of lgbtq+ definitions. She told me she has a lot of friends that are lgbtq+ and she even “dated” a girl for a week after she broke up with her first boyfriend. I couldn’t believe it. She’s bi? :D  ...Probably not. She said she thinks girls are pretty but she doesn’t feel anything like she does with guys. 

She doesn’t know I have a crush on her. I don’t think she knows I’m not straight. She said all her “...friends except two, are lgbtq. Well, except three including you. Wait, you’re straight, right? I thought you were.” I didn’t say anything and probably looked awkward. “Well it’s ok if you’re not, I don’t care.” I can change details in a story to manipulate the audience’s perception, but I can’t lie to someone’s face. 

I have a problem. I don’t like it and I don’t know why I have it. It’s really hard to talk to anyone about this problem. I have a hard time accepting the fact that I’m probably a lesbian. I keep thinking if I don’t acknowledge it then I won’t be. If I just keep it a secret and can get a boyfriend, I can learn to like guys. I don’t know why I can’t accept it. My family is supportive of lgbt, and so is everyone where I live. 

I think I’m like a hipster. I’ve always resented popular things and I didn’t know why. I thought about it for a while and I think it’s because popular things get criticized the most. If you like something super bland, it’s rare anyone will judge you. If you like something no one’s ever heard of, it’s impossible for them to judge you. Lgbtq has been accepted so much lately that it’s actually become kind of trendy in a way. I think I’m subconsciously afraid that people will think I’m identifying as lesbian to fit in. And maybe I actually am! Did I just think myself into being lesbian because it’s popular? If I’m actually straight repressing my desire for guys will harm me, and I’m doing this just to fit in?? How can I get my brain to just figure out what the heck I am?! 

Back to the story. I didn’t want her to know I might be lesbian. But I wanted to rant. I ranted about my 7th grade girlfriend. But I couldn’t say that. Also, my parents were in the house and they could’ve possibly overheard me talking. So I wrapped the truth in a lie. I feel really guilty about it, because I felt like I both had a choice and didn’t have a choice. I said she was like my best friend and we hung out constantly, I basically lived with her. Then she said she didn’t like me anymore and never talked to me again. (Really, we tried to date and she broke up with me.) 

I really like this girl, even if I know I most likely don’t have a chance with her. I don’t want to lose her trust. If I lied about one thing, what other things did I lie about? 

I feel like there’s a different between not saying you’re gay, and lying that you’re straight. The first is ok, but the second isn’t, and I did the second. Should I come clean and tell her the whole truth always? The only times I ever lie is to change the details to protect a secret. If it wasn’t a secret, I wouldn’t lie. Or should I not tell her? If she knows I’m a lesbian she’d probably find out I have a crazy crush on her, which would make me a creep because she has a boyfriend. But then I’d still be lying. 

What should I do? 

(And should I come out to my therapist so I can talk about this? Somehow over time I’ve developed a deep resentment for “coming out”. Now I think it’s become a little irrational, so maybe I’ll reconsider it. LGBT is so closely linked to politics though, and I’ve tried so hard to stay out of politics while talking to my counselor. And I don’t know how thin the walls are. If my family finds out I’m gay, I can’t ever un-come-out.) 

- 

**TL;DR:** My crush is probably straight and has a boyfriend she loves. I still really like her, even though I probably don’t have any chance. I don’t want her to know I’m lesbian, so I changed some details on stories about my 7th grade gf. I feel bad for lying because I don’t want to lose her trust. But I don’t want her to find out I have a crush on her because that would make me creep, since I know she’s taken. What should I do?","My crush has a boyfriend, and I feel bad about lying to her but I’m not sure I have a choice (TL;DR at the end)

Lgbtq has been accepted so much lately that it’s actually become kind of trendy in a way. I think I’m subconsciously afraid that people will think I’m identifying as lesbian to fit in. And maybe I actually am! Did I just think myself into being lesbian because it’s popular? If I’m actually straight repressing my desire for guys will harm me, and I’m doing this just to fit in?? How can I get my brain to just figure out what the heck I am?! 

Back to the story. I didn’t want her to know I might be lesbian. But I wanted to rant. I ranted about my 7th grade girlfriend. But I couldn’t say that. Also, my parents were in the house and they could’ve possibly overheard me talking. So I wrapped the truth in a lie. I feel really guilty about it, because I felt like I both had a choice and didn’t have a choice. I said she was like my best friend and we hung out constantly, I basically lived with her. Then she said she didn’t like me anymore and never talked to me again. (Really, we tried to date and she broke up with me.) 

I really like this girl, even if I know I most likely don’t have a chance with her. I don’t want to lose her trust. If I lied about one thing, what other things did I lie about? 

I feel like there’s a different between not saying you’re gay, and lying that you’re straight. The first is ok, but the second isn’t, and I did the second. Should I come clean and tell her the whole truth always? The only times I ever lie is to change the details to protect a secret. If it wasn’t a secret, I wouldn’t lie. Or should I not tell her? If she knows I’m a lesbian she’d probably find out I have a crazy crush on her, which would make me a creep because she has a boyfriend. But then I’d still be lying. 

What should I do? 

(And should I come out to my therapist so I can talk about this? Somehow over time I’ve developed a deep resentment for “coming out”. Now I think it’s become a little irrational, so maybe I’ll reconsider it. LGBT is so closely linked to politics though, and I’ve tried so hard to stay out of politics while talking to my counselor. And I don’t know how thin the walls are. If my family finds out I’m gay, I can’t ever un-come-out.) 

- 

**TL;DR:** My crush is probably straight and has a boyfriend she loves. I still really like her, even though I probably don’t have any chance. I don’t want her to know I’m lesbian, so I changed some details on stories about my 7th grade gf. I feel bad for lying because I don’t want to lose her trust. But I don’t want her to find out I have a crush on her because that would make me creep, since I know she’s taken. What should I do?"

teenagers,I just almost had a heart attack,"  30 minutes ago, my family was watching TV. Since all 5 of us couldn’t fit in one bed, my father sat in front of the bed. He put out his airpod for some reason, and I was just browsing reddit.

  Suddenly, a very, uhhh... *questionable* porn came up in my hime feed. Naturally, I felt intrigued. I wasn’t even horny, I was just curious. So I clicked it but it had no sound. I was like: “Huh, that’s weird. I unmuted the video itself.” Than I realized the airpods. **The motherfuggin airpods.** 

  I almost had a heart attack. I closed reddit immediately and acted natural. But dad said: “What is this noise?” ngl I have never been this terrified in my life. I said:”Wh, what noise?”

    Turns out his airpods were connected to his phone which my sister was using to watch among us youtube video. Also my volume was set so low I couldn’t hear it.

  Moral of the story: **TURN OFF THE VOLUME**","I just almost had a heart attack   30 minutes ago, my family was watching TV. Since all 5 of us couldn’t fit in one bed, my father sat in front of the bed. He put out his airpod for some reason, and I was just browsing reddit.

teenagers,Getting used,"There is this girl I've been talking to for awhile and we haven't started dating and I'm not sure that will happen. Her name is Jordan, Everything with her and I was going super well it really was. She has everything I could ever ask for in a girl. She was always super outgoing, caring, and she was just overall so supportive of everything. I always had little worries in the back of my mind because how fast her and I were moving together. Within a week of us really talking we already had sex, It kind of gave me a little bit of a red flag but I ignored it because I was happy with where I was at with her. I wanted to really cherish the little things with her and I felt like that didn't get to happen. Things were going super well, Her friends and family liked me and her and I would call every night. I went over to her house and had dinner with her family a lot and watched movies and spending that time with her really made the connection we had stronger. After a little we sat down and talked about if we wanted to really be together and she was ecstatic and was optimistic about the vision of us being together. She would always say she missed me and said how much she liked me. This went on for a little and one time when we were out having dinner she even dropped the ""I love you"" and I thought it was super cute and sweet, But also worried me a little more about how fast things were moving. I've always been a little cautious with love because I feel like a lot of people don't know what love is really like, Especially at a young age, I'm 18 she turns 17 in exactly a month. I can even say I don't fully know either. It still made me wonder what if she is talking to other guys, Because if she moves so fast with me who is to say she isn't doing it with other guys behind my back too. To this day I still don't know if she is talking to other guys as well. The feelings I had for her were definitely coming but It reminded me of a past girl, Her name was Melanie. It was the same situation almost to the tee. Melanie was the first the first girl I could confidentially say I loved. For the first few months after Melanie I would break down If I even slightly tried to talk about her, It took 10 months before I felt like I was over her. Its been 11 months since Melanie and I split. I feel like I compare every girl to Melanie, Especially with Jordan. The situations are so similar and it always sat in the back of my mind. If I wanted to I could easily get all caught up about Melanie again and cry about her. I choose to ignore any of those thoughts and accept that that's in the past. With me having those worries in mind when I was trying to really get more comfortable and trust Jordan It made it hard, I felt like I could really have a future with her but I am worried I wont be able to love her, Not that that matter anymore. About 2 weeks ago Jordan texted me talking about worries with us and things with my personal life. I listened to her and I started to change my bad habits into good ones. I was willing to change not just for her but for myself and so I did. Things were getting better again and then out of no where she sends me a long paragraph about how she doesn't wanna actually be with me and never really saw me in her future. It hurt a lot but I was understanding. The thing that really fucked me up was when she went back to normal out of no where saying she wants me and misses me. Talking about us hanging out and cuddling. I was super confused and approached her about it and she went back again saying we are just friends. Again I was understanding and accepting of it. No matter how much it hurt, With her knowing my friends and family it sucks to tell them what happened because It just doesn't feel right to me. To say it all is over. The same day she talked about us being friends with benefits and I was unsure, But was okay with it. Things went on and we stopped talking for a few days and drifted a little. I decided to hit her up and see how things were and the texting slowly came back to her liking me and missing me again out of nowhere. We talked about our sex life and she flipped on me out of nowhere. She went on and on about how I only wanted her body and only wanted sex from her. She told her friend and they both just came at me out of nowhere for it. I tried as hard as I could to explain that isn't true but she got even more mad and talked about how she was glad she knew I only wanted sex and she dodged a bullet basically. We stopped talking for a little again. Again we texted and talked, Things got more normal but she wasn't saying she liked me or missed me anymore. It was just like friends but with a little tension. Fast forward a day or two and I just tell her I miss her, She says she misses me too and we talk about just cuddling and making plans to see each other soon. She was super flakey and dry when texting me during this, She was also rude with what she would say, Disregarding how I felt. I lived with it, Today she came over with a friend saying she wanted to talk to me about something, They get here and we sit in my room and Jordan never really had anything she wanted to talk about she just said it for some reason. I'm unsure how to feel or what to do because I don't wanna cut her out of my life but also don't feel like getting my emotions played with. I have yet to cry about it or anything and It feels weird, I could cry over Melanie right now, But Jordan? I'm not sure. I feel like I could but I feel like that's not how I feel, I don't feel like I need to cry over her, Maybe its because she is still slightly leading me on and in the back of my mind I get a false sense of security from it or maybe since I'm always surrounded by people I don't feel like I'm alone in the sense that I have people I can go to and hangout with, Even though I don't yet feel ready to talk about Jordan to anyone. I apologize if this was all over the place but I wanted to get it off my chest and explain how I felt in some form. I was hesitant to post this here but I figured I'd open up a little more.

teenagers,The End,"Idk why I am writing this but here I go. So when I(F17) was in 7th grade(13), used to bite my fingernails a lot and I was really insecure because of my terrible looking fingernails. So back then in my school, we used to exchange classes with the seniors during our test days, every student was seated with a senior, the seating plans were made according to our roll numbers and it was fixed, the entire session, during every exam, you gotta sit with the same chosen senior. So I shared my seat with a really cute senior, she smelled really good and had pretty, long, beautiful painted nails.
For the whole session, while writing exams I would legit make a fist with my left hand, place it on the table and I used to turn in a awkward position and write so she couldn't see my right hand. 

Yesterday I saw her in a departmental store, I looked at her and smiled only to find out that she doesn't recognise me(anymore?)

teenagers,How can I be happy without her?,"My girlfriend recently broke up with me, weve been fighting a lot because I've been paranoid of her leaving me which has been putting a lot of strain on the relationship. The only way she feels to fix it is to say it's over, it happened 2 days ago and it been hard to leave my bed or stop crying. I dont know how to let go of the paranoia that it's over forever, I've never been as happy as I was with her.
She wants to stay friends and when we talk not much has changed, it's a far distance relationship so i couldnt touch her anyway but we didnt mind. Now she just doesnt seem to want to talk to me any more than she does any other normal friend and she actively avoids using gestures for our love, saying at the same time that it's hard to do so.
She says she still loves me but she doesnt want me to hold on to the hope that well be together again.
I'm just so confused what to do, all I want is to be with her but how do I stop being paranoid of losing her. And even more how do I get her back if i finally do have myself back to where I was when the relationship started?
With corona I cant enjoy things as much anymore, and gaming feels like wasting time. Does anyone have advice how to enjoy myself independently when the biggest joy of your life is telling you it's over forever?","How can I be happy without her?

After that he gets the familiar feeling he always gets after he hears padme scream as loud as she can from the pain he fires a ton of cum from each one of his 17 cocks.

teenagers,r/teenagers is a breeding ground for creeps and pedos,"Seriously.

Now, I'm 22 years old, not exactly a teenager anymore, but honestly it sickens me seeing some of the stuff on this subreddit. I don't hang out here often but this is one of the multiple times that I've seen a post hit [r/all](https://www.reddit.com/r/all/) and decided to check it out, only to see 18 year olds talking to 13/14 year olds about sucking dick or getting fingered, or talking about even sharing nudes. I know that stuff might seem funny to talk about to you but I beg you guys to think about that for a moment. This is not ok.

It doesn't follow the rules of trying to make this a healthy place to talk about sex, but one where every kid going through puberty is just airing out all their sexual thoughts, making them prime targets for pedos to come in and try to groom them. You might not think it could be a thing, but trust me, it is. I know from experience unfortunately. It isn't that hard for them to change their flair to be around your age and strike up a weird sexual conversation.

Just be careful. And stop giving those creeps a way for them to get to you. Don't let the idea of sex consume your mind to a point where you're blurting out everything on an online forum just to get a few points or validation. It's not worth it.

Do something about this mods.","r/teenagers is a breeding ground for creeps and pedos Seriously.

teenagers,Here’s a crazy teacher story,"So now, this teacher wasn’t nearly as bad as some other teachers where they would physically hit kids but, into the story. So this teacher was the schools strictest teacher. It was the teacher all your friends would want you about to get in her good side. So enter me, good grades, hard working student. On the first day of school, I sat next to my twin and his friend, and his friend would not shut up. The next day she puts me in the other side of the room from my brother and his friend (didn’t think about it much but now I feel like this was intentional). So now after that,  pretty sure she thought I was the one who was talking to my brother on the first day because after that, she decided she did not like me at all. If I went into really big detail we would be here forever so I’ll go over a few. In September I asked to use the bathroom (first time I asked and I was done with my work) she then responds in a snarky voice “You have to wait for us to check it” (she didn’t even check it for like a good 5 minutes later) I then asked after she checked it and she said “No becuase the period is almost over”. Just why. The second time was in February (the second ever time I asked to use the bathroom in that class and I asked because I was done with my work) and she flat out sad no. Great teacher here. I have another one for you. It was somewhere at the end of the school year. I was doing my work (way ahead of everyone else because for some reason we didn’t have honors science in sixth grade) and I decided to stretch. I don’t mean like full get out of your set but like put your arms out in different directions and stretch. The stretch couldn’t of lasted for more than 2 seconds but teacher of the year comes by and goes “Look at you OP. You are doing nothing like you always have been and always will be.” Honestly, don’t know why she hated me for the entire school year. You would think she would forget about it. I told all of this to my mom and she said maybe because I got good grades with little effort? I honestly don’t know. Anyways fuck that teacher never wanna see her again","Here’s a crazy teacher story So now, this teacher wasn’t nearly as bad as some other teachers where they would physically hit kids but, into the story.

Oh and also how he then proceeds to treat me like a teddy bear and snuggle up close to me and breath on my neck for the next hour so I'm afraid to move.

teenagers,I'm turning 17 and I hate it,"So I'm a girl, currently still ""sweet 16"" and I feel like as soon as I turn 17 I'm gonna be too old to have my ""firsts""

Let me explain. I did an exchange year shortly after I turned 15 and came back when I had just turned 16 (January this year). Everything went well, I thought I was gonna live that teenagers life to it's fullest from then on, sweet 16 yk... yeah, no. 

Corona happened.

 I went out partying once, then bars and schools closed down. Most people were too scared to meet up. 

i had just switched classes but the school shut down after only 4 weeks. 

Yes, you can make friends in that time, but not really. What about my old friends? Things were different... I met up with most of them once/ twice and then we stopped because the chemistry was too weird. 

So yeah, on Tuesday I'll be turning 17 and I've never had a boyfriend, I've never even been kissed,  I've never been to a real club, I've never been high, never had a hangover, never nothing ever. 

And as nice as my life was before corona, it got really depressed and hopeless around May, I'd say. 

Now I just feel like I'll be too old soon to not know all this, too old to try this and it would be okay if I didn't know how to. I feel everyone around me has done and experienced so much more of ""what teenagers do"" and they're all just turning 16...  and my other friends tried all that while I was away.

Anyone can relate?","I'm turning 17 and I hate it So I'm a girl, currently still ""sweet 16"" and I feel like as soon as I turn 17 I'm gonna be too old to have my ""firsts""

teenagers,College apps suck.,"Title. They’re giving me so much stress. I just did a mid semester transfer overseas as well, as I returned to the states for a short while with my family due to covid.

As this counts everything that's separated by spaces it picks up some numbers to.  


If you have suggestions what script I shall do next I am open for suggestions.  
I am planning on doing \[Shrek, Shrek 2, The bible\]","I made a script counting every word in the script of the bee movie. This was inspired by the letter counting script of  [u/sneakyhobbitses1900](https://www.reddit.com/user/sneakyhobbitses1900/)  


I remade the script in c++, with it counting the words instead of the chars,

teenagers,So my school finally closed down on wednesday and god damn the tension i feel is like an anime cliff hanger,"If this dont make sense dont worry, my memory of tuesday is crap. 

So basically, at the end of my school day on tuesday, one of the girls in my music class called me just as i was going to leave the grounds. 

So i turn around and she catches up to me and says 
""You know this other girl (she said her name but privacy and shit)  she thinks you're hot""

Im a lil surprised and say ""ok"" then she says sumin else (i forgot)  and i say ""ok... So?"" And she just walks away. 

I feel like a dick, i've felt like one since tuesday. And guess what? I had music at the end of the day wednesday and my school closed the second lesson so i dont even know whats gonna happen, i dont have either of the girls numbers and wont be back at school until the 9th. 

This has turned from a rant to a question, WHAT DO I DO? 

also bear in mind i'm not the coolest or hottest guy at all, and this aint humbleness, im literally one of the silent kids who just does his work and chats with his mates. 

And i dont even know who this other girl is, I only knew about her when i asker my mates.

teenagers,I JUST DID THE ULTIMATE PRANK,"So I watched this video about somebody putting wasabi into gum. And I just got sushi, so there was a lot of wasabi. 

I followed some steps of the video and created wasabi that actually looked like real gum. So I put it in the gum wrappers (and I marked the actual gum for me to eat) And the next day I headed to school.

In school, i was walking around the halls thinking on how I should execute the prank. 

And then, in the middle of class, when I pulled out a piece of REAL gum and ate it, the teacher said the greatest thing. 

She said ""don't you have enough gum for the rest of the class?""
So I said ""yeah I guess"" and she told me to share.

You can probably tell what happened next, classmates going crazy, teacher being confused...

teenagers,So uh. I'm alive for now.,"This transmission is being sent out into the void. For record keeping, I suppose. I don't expect you to read it because it probably doesn't make sense anyways. :) 










I am alive. I regret that. A few times I've nearly killed myself but I obviously never put my all into it, since I'm still here. I don't know if I want to be dead, if I'm being completely honest. I guess it just has nuance like everything else in this world. I don't want to be dead, but if I had the option to just not exist, I'd probably chose that. Then nobody would know I was gone. Nobody would have to pay for my funeral. Nobody would have to blame themselves.


But it's fine. I'm here and I'm probably not going to kill myself. Things seem to be looking a bit up, which is disturbing, considering I very likely have covid (my sister tested positive. I'm getting tested tomorrow). I feel a bit ill, but my emotions have been a bit better, which is what I'm more focused on. I'm in antidepressants but uh.... Biggg shocker I still have to put effort towards trying to be a more stable person. They don't just magically make me happy. So over been trying to be better. Still have intrusive thoughts about hurting myself or other people, but I will not let those thoughts define me. They are not me.


Anyways this had no point other than just an excuse to ramble. I'm going to sleep even though it's 5 am now. Good night/morning/afternoon/evening :)","So uh. I'm alive for now.

teenagers,My bad luck,"Soooooo this is embarrassing

I am 16 years old and today I something bad happened.
I was home alone and after attending my online classes I called my girlfriend over who by the grace of God was alone at home too. So naturally she came over and things got a little heated. Don't get me wrong I am 16 years old for God's sake so we haven't moved pass first base. She stayed over for an hour and so and we had atleast 3 goodbye kisses.
Now the important thing to know is that I had a big meal the last night, and trust me when I say big I mean bigggggggg. So naturally all that food needed a way out and it couldn't have come at a more inappropriate moment. But i held it in. Now my gf says that it is getting late and she should probably go home. I was overjoyed. She had just stepped out the door i ripped my clothes off and sat down to drop a deuce. But now being the clumsy butt I am I forgot to lock that door. I had been sitting for about 2 minutes when suddenly my gf burst into my room, turns out she had forgot her mask in my room. Can you freaking believe it. HER MASK!! So now my door is open, I am completely undressed and my face is redder than a cherry blossom. She screamed and quickly ran out of the house. I hastily got dressed and ran after her but she had already left. Now it has been 10 hours since this ""event"" and I have had no contact with her. I think she is probably gonna dump me now (and no the double meaning of ""dump"" is not lost on me). I know I can't do anything but wait, but it feels good to share this.","My bad luck Soooooo this is embarrassing

teenagers,pls help,"okay so, two months ago i broke up with my girlfriend which used to be my best friend. i loved her but it just didn't work out. we agreed on staying friends but as the days went on she distanced herself and i stopped interacting with her.  two weeks after the break up she had a new boyfriend to which she was 
definitely talking while i was her man. it hurt me a lot and a week ago she called me to ask me if I'm fine and i honestly was to an extent, i wasn't really thinking of her but my life was still pretty sad and depressing.
 she dmed me like a day or two after with something like "" i haven't come up with a good way to apologize other than to sing you  sorry by justin bieber but i don't think u wanna hear that""
two days after she texted again 
""its clear to me you won't even read these and I'm not mad at you bc you have the full right to be mad at me, but i was swapping my sd card and found this video and i think it's pretty funny""
(the video was something i sent her like 5-6 months ago)
i just replied saying 
"" look i really want to be friends again, bc you truly were one of the closes people ive had, but i still have feelings for you and knowning that you have someone else makes me feel really bad and if we keep talking i don't think ill be able to move on bc i hurt myself that way. i miss talking to you. you hurt me a lot and i want to accept your apology but not now""
she replied
""okay, i completely respect your decision, i know what i did was really bad, i miss talking to you as well. but I'll wait for as long as you need. i know i hurt you a lot and it will be hard for you to accept my apology but i hope you can one day""




okay now thing is. ive been really sad and it's been really hard for me to meet new people and with quarantine all clubs and pretty much everything's been closed. i was hoping to go to a place and learn drums and guitar with hopes of finding people with similar interests and hopefully make friends. ive been going out with these guys the last week but i don't really feel wanted there bc only two of the people there text me or invite me. i always feel uninvited. 

i feel as if everyone has people and close ones and I've lost the only ones i did have. i want to talk to her again bc we could talk about everything with her when we were friends, our relationship really didn't work out and just casually texting and stuff like that felt weird and out of order. i know it will hurt me but i need social interaction again.

 I've been isolating myself for the past two months bc i don't get invited anywhere. my usual day would be to wake up, take online classes, eat, go to the gym and play video games. now that gyms are closed as well my hobbies are just gone and I can't get into the new ones i wanted to. 

i don't understand why I can't let her go and why she can't let me go. older friends on reddit have told me it's bc we're young and we don't know how to fight and express these feelings or that we both fear losing each other fully. if i do become her best friend again it'll hurt me but maybe help me meet new people.

last time she tried to interact while i still saw her irl was just showing me an old photo she took of me from last year, i ignored her and didn't bother saying anything. 

if for some reason you decided to read through this bs thank you and have a nice day :)","pls help okay so, two months ago i broke up with my girlfriend which used to be my best friend. i loved her but it just didn't work out. we agreed on staying friends but as the days went on she distanced herself and i stopped interacting with her.  two weeks after the break up she had a new boyfriend to which she was

teenagers,Apparently vanilla extract is dangerous in large amounts,"I mean, no shit, everything is dangerous in large amounts. But apparently some woman in my town would dump bags and bags of vanilla extract she'd drank on a backroad, this happened for years until police set up a camera and caught her. I guess enough vanilla extract has the same effect as alcohol, but worse. Alcohol poisoning, hypothermia, breathing difficulties, a bunch of relatively unpleasant sounding side effects.









In other words, I think I know how I wanna go out.","Apparently vanilla extract is dangerous in large amounts I mean, no shit, everything is dangerous in large amounts.

teenagers,I can't be the only one who thinks this,"Has anyone else just gotten tired of all tje ""2020 bad"" memes. A lot of them have just gotten repetitive. Most of the time its a list of everything bad that's happened with some bad reaction meme template or it says everything bad that's happened each month and then something super bad for the next month. I don't hate the people who make these memes, heck when some new bad thing happens they can be funny for a while. I understand this year sucks but I really don't what to hear it every five seconds.  I come to reddit to try to relax but being reminded of how much the world sucks can put me on edge. I'm sorry if I'm being a snowflake or whatever.","I can't be the only one who thinks this Has anyone else just gotten tired of all tje ""2020 bad"" memes. A lot of them have just gotten repetitive.

teenagers,I am too impatient,"My crush and I admitted, through a good friend of both of us, that we like each other like literally a couple nights ago, and I just absolutely cannot wait to go on our first date and actually start doing relationship things.

Also, I feel like we both feel that way but as soon as we start actually dating it'll get better. For now, all I can do is enjoy the thought of one day holding her in my arms tightly and watching her cute laugh. And her smile, it's crazy. I can't believe she liked ME. She likes me too. Wow. I used to think it was such a reach that she would ever like me, like a celebrity crush. I just can't wait to watch the stars with her, and go hiking together, and watch movies occasionally. Anything with her is fine because at any time I get to look over and enjoy her smile, her laugh, her... well, I guess it ends there for now. I haven't seen enough of her yet. I want to. I can't wait to learn so much about her that I feel like I know more about her than she does of herself. I hope that's not weird. I just want her to be happy. Does anyone else feel this way about this new of a relationship? It's my first btw.","I am too impatient My crush and I admitted, through a good friend of both of us, that we like each other like literally a couple nights ago, and I just absolutely cannot wait to go on our first date and actually start doing relationship things.

teenagers,Alright hear me out.,"**TLDR:** Did you notice masturbating in your teens like 15,16,17-year-old have an effect on your height?

I  had a random shower thought about this the other day. Some of my  friends in high school that I knew were avid wankers (at least once a  day type of shit) were quite short by the time they graduated. By Short,  I mean like 5'9, which is like in the average/short category here in  Australia. Like most of my friends reached 6'0-1 by the time of  graduation, but they were also the nerdy kind, so I'm assuming they  didn't do it as much which possibly attributed to their height.

Now  I'm saying this because I used to be addicted to it back when I was 15  and was almost a daily at that age. Now at 18 I'm 5'11, my brother is  6'4 at 19 (dad is 5'11). I never had that 'growth spurt' like my brother  did at 16 (mf grew 3 inches), mine was always like 0.5 cm every 6  months. From what I have noticed ever since the dawn of sibling  relationships is that the younger brother is always taller than the  older one or the same height. I have noticed this with basically every 2  two brothers I've come across in my life. This makes me wonder if this  hypothesis is actually true or not. I'm sure he didn't masturbate as  much as I did, or at least not that I know of, but still a 4-inch gap  WTF. Hurts the ego man.","Alright hear me out. **TLDR:** Did you notice masturbating in your teens like 15,16,17-year-old have an effect on your height?

teenagers,My friend sent me this at 3 am and I'm terrified,"I agree with you, bro, this world is made up of large, medium and small particles, based on humanity, love, goodness and friendship. Our task is to join hands and destroy the space idiots by attacking other planets. They prevented the formation of other civilizations. To deal with them, we have to put a pot on our heads and fight them with a frying pan, because they are our enemies and they do not know. Then we ride a single-legged cow and go to attack. Because the rays of their eyes and the two people on earth prevent them from disappearing under the water. They are high and they reproduce a lot because they have a lot of hormones with high secretions. They have to respect each other. The US president and the president and Mars also helped to lift the zipper of their pants because they have wooden sticks in both hands and feet. Now in this case we have to take a pillow and attack, of course, a sword and A mixture of eggplant soup is not bad either, it makes the sword stronger and stronger. I have to tell you a few points 1_ Put shirk on your shoulder. Shrek with its golden teeth prevents the zipper and the temperature of their fingers from rising. 2_Eggplant soup and its string soup should be placed in a tank tube to prevent the destruction of cucumbers and watermelons. Light a moonlight to blind their sick eyes. 4_Wrap a belt around your head and turn it around a hundred times and then say Allahu Akbar. Well, these are the points I made, but I forgot to say this. They put seventy vehicles in the zipper of their pants, one of which is polytheism and the planet-destroyer spacecraft.","My friend sent me this at 3 am and I'm terrified I agree with you, bro, this world is made up of large, medium and small particles, based on humanity, love, goodness and friendship.

teenagers,i think i made my closest friend hate me,"earlier, she was complaining to me about how she hated one of my friends. I told her that she didn't have to be in the discord server, and that we had a group DM for a reason. She still insisted that she stay in the server, and we argued for a bit longer. Eventually she left the server, and i told her she didn't have to leave the server if she didn't want too. She then said ""apparently you don't care""

I told her I did care. She then said how she thinks everyone hates her, and i told her that's not true, and she said ""well it sure feels like it."" I told her I didn't have the energy to deal with this (struggling with my own thoughts).

She got mad at me. I'll just read what the DMs said as it's hard to explain.
""I guess you don't remember how many times I was there for you""
""so late at night""
""but that's fine""
""it's not easy""

I felt terrible. I was sick to my stomach because she's right. I'm just not mentally prepared for somebody else's problems though. It's been 6 hours since this argument and i can't sleep. It feels like she's literally the only person that cared about me. I've apologized like 3 times but i think she left me on read.

teenagers,Hello teens! I will now tell you my theory of why time travel is possible.,"So, you have probably heard the official explanation of why time travel is impossible. You know the shit when you’re locked in a room and the future self comes and opens up the door, but how did you get out int the first place to then be able to lock up the door for you? The answer is not time travel, it’s alternate dimensions. So time travel is not you going back in time it’s you going to an alternate dimension at a specific time, so you forever leave your current dimension and choose to live as a double in the dimension you traveled to, just to open a door for someone else that is you. But because all alternate dimensions are in sync you can go back to you home dimension and go through the door because you opened it in another in sync dimension. And there you go that’s why “time travel” is possible (based on the fact other dimensions exist) this is the Proxy theory. (I haven’t seen this anywhere else so I consider this an original thought.)","Hello teens! I will now tell you my theory of why time travel is possible.

Told me to put my earphones in and shut up, I do, and I bother no one bar the odd helping someone out or responding. She says something, I didn't bear her, but no big deal. She doesn't seem happy by the end of period 2. Then we have one period of Religion on Friday. She decides to beat it into me. I was passing around food as one does, and most of the class was eating under their masks. Following this, I put my earphones in and start watching a video in class. People make animal noises, and I bark once. She is onto me for that. But ok, fair enough, I shouldnt have done that. Then she moves me to front of class. I say ""Can you speak up a bit, Miss"". She doesnt like that. I move up to the front, and continue watching a video. She starts walking around, sees me on my phone, she sees others playing games and all. At the end if the class, she wants to talk to me. I wait, she takes my phone, and I ask why. She says that I was the only person not working. At this point I was thinking "" The others probably changed their screen while she was looking"". I go into next class, and the deputy principle calls me out of class. He takes me to his office and shows me the offences I have committed. I was apparently eating in class, like the majority of the class. I was making rude noises, like the majority of the class. I was rude to her for asking her to speak a little louder. I was inappropriately on my phone. But the deputy was sound, he said he would give me my phone back at the end of the day and that he knows it was just the pressure making me so this. He tells me to go and say sorry to the teacher, and to not tell her that he will give me my phone back so soon. I am fuming, but I think it is understandable. On my way, I see someone from my class and he tells me that she watched them play games on their phones. Bells started ringing in my head. I go and lick her arse dry and she has a smug look on her face like as if though she won the olympics fencing medal with a piece of bread. I go home and my dad starts questioning me. I alter the story coz I dont want trouble and I know that he will scream racism and make a big deal out of it if he finds out the truth. But I alter the story so it sounded like I was taken with all of the boys in mjy class and I had barely anything to do with it, because he will beat the fuck out of me if he finds out that I was using my phone in class for other than school purposes. 

TL;DR Teacher picks on me, have my phone taken, get it back, had to say sorry, find out she was being a prick for no reason, parents find out, I change the story a little, now the truth is about to come out.","My Religion teacher is a racist prick This story starts on thursday, when I had 2 periods of religion in a row.

teenagers,I can't sleeep and I have to wake up at 9 :(,"Some more shit I want to say so I remember the bad things about him and not think about the good parts. He would really push for a sexual relationship even tho I would tell him that I wasn't ready, he would say that he understands, but then leave hickeys on me. I would tell him not to do that because I dont have makeup other than mascara and highlighter so like it's hard to cover that shit up. Also with his drugs, he would always ask if I wanted to try even tho I had already stopped talking to him because of that. Like he didn't really have respect for me sometimes, like I was just an object for him. He would also offer me a lot of food, and idk why but this always seemed wierd to me. Like idk if it was like him saying that I can eat a lot in front of him and he wanted me to be comfortable with him or somthing idk. I always only eat 2 slices of pizza, he would push for me to eat more, when he would invite me to eat he would offer a lot of food even tho I was full he would say to eat more, of course I didn't because I was full but idk I'm thinking he wanted me to gain some pounds and not take care of myself so others won't like me. Idk I'm just hoping he finds someone else like him so I don't have to deal with his shit. I dont have anyone to talk to rn so y'all are hearing this now. Thank uu :)","I can't sleeep and I have to wake up at 9 :( Some more shit I want to say so I remember the bad things about him and not think about the good parts.

teenagers,I made out with my crush's friend...,"So I usually hang out with two of my friends (both of them are males and I might have a crush on the other one, I still think them both only as my friends) at school. I think that they have been friends for 5 years (I've known them for 2 years) and they are very different. I usually talk more with my ""crush"" because we have same interests etc and we have stronger connection, people often ask me that do I like him and I always just say that we are friends. 

So the other friend invited me to his party week ago and well I got very drunk. I slept in his bed with him because it was the only available place. Nothing had happened yet, but in the morning when we woke up we talked and for some reason he kissed me. So we ended up making out and cuddling for couple hours.

Here is the problem. First of all he is not my type at all and I don't know how it happened. Both of us act like nothing happened and I don't think that he told anyone (I only told my best friend because I was freaking out). After all that happened, my ""crush"" has been showing more interest in me and I'm confused if he is just being friendly. And I'm not even sure if I have crush on him.

I just wish that this wouldn't have happened, everything would be easier...","I made out with my crush's friend...

teenagers,Anyone watch the Toyshow?,"Last night the 2020 Late Late Toyshow was aired for the first time. I like to say that if you are Irish, the criteria for being a child os watching the toyshow. And i wanna know who else enjoyed it. I love the toyshow because the reunions, celebrity guests and just everything about it is so special. Its the Irish equivalent of the John Lewis ad. 
This year I loved the lil gal with cancer because she in all technicality raised 5 million euro in just a few hours. I also loved the wee laddie who came second last. His thoughts when WhatsHisFace McSingerMan came on were: *Bop bop boppity bop. Huh? Is it just me or is someone else sin-OH MY GOD ITS WHATSHISFACE MC-FLIPPIN-SINGERMAN.* But the Red Rockodile(the final chap) was.... underwhelming. So yeah, who's Irish round this joint and did you sneak in a watch? Give me a yell.","Anyone watch the Toyshow? Last night the 2020 Late Late Toyshow was aired for the first time.

teenagers,"my parents think i'm failing school because i'm lazy and ""want to play videogames""","they are completely wrong and don't even know it. the only game i play is minecraft, and i only play it to pass time. i really only have four actual classes, and have no motivation to try at all. whenever i force myself to sit down and try and do work (which is extremely often) i get extremely stressed and sad because i know if i don't start to catch up, i won't graduate high school. i've been basically trying to bury my demons with a spoon, which obviously isn't working. i've started to grow further apart from one of my only friends which of course isn't helping. i also feel left out during family get togethers, which we do very often. this all contributes to why i'm doing so poorly in school.

thank you for listening. move along now.","my parents think i'm failing school because i'm lazy and ""want to play videogames"" they are completely wrong and don't even know it. the only game i play is minecraft, and i only play it to pass time. i really only have four actual classes, and have no motivation to try at all. whenever i force myself to sit down and try and do work (which is extremely often) i get extremely stressed and sad because i know if i don't start to catch up, i won't graduate high school. i've been basically trying to bury my demons with a spoon, which obviously isn't working. i've started to grow further apart from one of my only friends which of course isn't helping. i also feel left out during family get togethers, which we do very often. this all contributes to why i'm doing so poorly in school.

teenagers,Okay so I need some advice like RIGHT NOW,"I’ve been talking to this girl since June(I technically met her in June of last year through a gc that she left instantly but we only had small conversation until this June when we started getting to know each other) she messaged me saying she had a dream about me. and the weird thing was I had the same dream about her (it was literary just like the dream she explained so there’s no way she faked it) so I told her I had the same dream and that’s how we started talking. We talked maybe a few days a week but talked to each other more and more each day to the point where there wasn’t a day we didn’t talk to each other. So to this present point we both have said we really like each other (we haven’t gotten further then saying we both have a crush On each other) and send those wholesome relationship memes to each other and we say good morning and good night every day. But I want to make the move and ask her if she’d wanna be my girlfriend but I’m just to scared to. She’s the only girl I’ve talkin to and she would be my first girlfriend (I’m 15 she’s 14, she turns 15 mid next month) so I have no idea how to talk to girls and any help would be helpful","Okay so I need some advice like RIGHT NOW I’ve been talking to this girl since June(I technically met her in June of last year through a gc that she left instantly but we only had small conversation until this June when we started getting to know each other) she messaged me saying she had a dream about me. and the weird thing was I had the same dream about her (it was literary just like the dream she explained so there’s no way she faked it) so I told her I had the same dream and that’s how we started talking.

If yes pls tell me abt it,"I had to delete my 12k karma account cuz this guy was a psychopath and I was scared he was gonna look for me in my city cuz he was only a couple hours away and I had to change my appearance just in case but I never gave him personal info such as phone number or family members names or my high school or anything like that just my first name and my age and the name of the city I live in but damn I was just tryna make friends why it always gotta backfire!!! I even changed the way I type on this account just in case he’s still looking for me or notices similarities 🥶🥶🥶 

It was crazy man I was paranoid for the longest time but in retrospect I was just overreacting and yeah never trying to make Reddit friends again lol 

I tried to look up his username on here to see if he was saying anything but i think his account got deleted or something but that is a good thing anyways tell me your stories","Do y’all ever meet someone on here and start messaging them and they’re ok at first but then they turn out to be absolutely insane?

teenagers,"saying ""ok"" isn't a response","it really pisses me off when I see somebody say ""ok"". It doesn't do anything besides make it seem like you don't give a shit and comes off as very annoying.

also, queue the ""ok"" chain in the comments. I know it's happening.","saying ""ok"" isn't a response it really pisses me off when I see somebody say ""ok"". It doesn't do anything besides make it seem like you don't give a shit and comes off as very annoying.

teenagers,I learned today someone I know is anorexic,"This made me feel really sad and I just wanted to say something to all the self conscious girls out there.

If you are trying to lose weight because other girls are saying you are ugly or fat, screw them. If someone doesn't like you because of the way you look then you can't change their mind.

If you are trying to lose weight because you have a crush on someone, let me tell you something. I am a guy and my first priority in a girl is their personality, and I am sure that 99% of guys are like this. My priority list is as follows...

1. Personality
2. Makes me laugh and I am comfortable around them
3. Mutual respect 
4. Attractiveness 

If you are losing weight for yourself, good on you! But there are MUCH healthier ways than to not eat. Exercise helps and HEALTHY eating. Because you only have 1 burger every two days doesn't mean you are eating healthy. Healthy eating is eating things that are good for you everyday. Teenagers shouldn't go on diets. We are still young and growing meaning teenagers should eat lots of healthy food. If you don't know what is healthy and what is not, ask a friend or family member or search it up! 

And also I know there are anorexic guys as well but there are a LOT more girls that are following these unhealthy eating habits.","I learned today someone I know is anorexic This made me feel really sad and I just wanted to say something to all the self conscious girls out there.

damn. i feel like i wasted it all, you know? i did switch schools a lot and i'd like to blame my loneliness on that but maybe i'm just, i dunno, unlikeable? i'm 16 and gonna graduate at 17 so i feel like a year was stolen from me. oh well.","i'm a senior in high school and i just realized high school wasn't how i imagined it all like i had no friends. zip. zilch. zero. nada. i thought high school was gonna be way better than middle school, and like i planned to have like a friend group and they'd be a bunch of girls who would give me a makeover and teach me how to do makeup and have a good fashion sense and maybe i'd have a crush or bf or something and maybe my friends and i would go to gas stations and movie theaters and the mall and stuff like they do in the movies, but all that happened was that for these past four years I tried my hardest not to kill myself, survived a couple attempts, and had literally no one to talk to about my struggles and shit.

teenagers,Last two nights were one of the best nights I've ever experienced...,"Day before yesterday, I was talking to a friend while sitting on rooftop; when he hung up I saw a shooting star ( first time ).
The sky was looking lovely at 12am and the shooting star was just the cherry on the top:)

And yk what happened last night? I was so sad and anxious , I went upstairs and climbed to rooftop and spend 30 minutes without phone and stuff ( from 11:30 to 12:00) . I literally cried looking at constellations (Sky was so clear, I could see Orion ,Ursa Major) and yeah Mars in the south west of moon.

Those tears were of happiness and ofcourse realizatiion of being a part of this beautiful creation hits hard..

Just wanted to share to y'all &lt;3","Last two nights were one of the best nights I've ever experienced... Day before yesterday, I was talking to a friend while sitting on rooftop; when he hung up I saw a shooting star ( first time ).

Really just looking for some help, and if you have any questions I’ll be happy to answer. Thanks.","What should my first anime(show)be?

I’m not really sure what anime is like and stuff...like I’ve watched some movies and I really enjoyed the Avatar series, but I know those aren’t actually animes. Really just looking for some help, and if you have an questions I’ll be happy to answer. Thanks."

teenagers,I just missed out on the chance of a lifetime,"FML

I signed up for this great opportunity that would look really good on a college resume and could’ve been very profitable. I didn’t think I would get but lo and behold I got a text saying I was one of the few to get it. I keep reading and it says that I have to do a live group call and my anxiety shot through the roof and I immediately deleted the conversation. The worst thing is that it had the link in the text and since the contact wasn’t saved in my phone, I had no way of asking for the link again. I’ve spent the past 20 minutes upset because I didn’t backup my phone so I can’t get the text from the cloud. I feel like I just ruined my future and any hopes of becoming rich and successful.

teenagers,Let me tell you a tale,"[Skyrim opens with an Imperial wagon driving four prisoners down a snowy
mountain pass. All are seated and bound; the one dressed in finery is gagged.]

Ralof: Hey, you. You’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border,
right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that
thief over there.

Lokir: D**n you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was
nice and lazy. If they hadn’t been looking for you, I could’ve stolen
that horse and been half way to Hammerfell. You there. You and me — we
should be here. It’s these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.

Ralof: We’re all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.

Imperial Soldier: Shut up back there!

[Lokir looks at the gagged man.]

Lokir: And what’s wrong with him?

Ralof: Watch your tongue! You’re speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High
King.

Lokir: Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You’re the leader of the rebellion. But if
they captured you… Oh gods, where are they taking us?

Ralof: I don’t know where we’re going, but Sovngarde awaits.

Lokir: No, this can’t be happening. This isn’t happening.

Ralof: Hey, what village are you from, horse thief?

Lokir: Why do you care?

Ralof: A Nord’s last thoughts should be of home.

Lokir: Rorikstead. I’m…I’m from Rorikstead.

[They approach the village of Helgen. A soldier calls out to the lead wagon.]

Imperial Soldier: General Tullius, sir! The headsman is waiting!

General Tullius: Good. Let’s get this over with.

Lokir: Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me.

Ralof: Look at him, General Tullius the Military Governor. And it looks like
the Thalmor are with him. D**n elves. I bet they had something to do
with this.

This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here. Wonder if Vilod
is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in. Funny…when I
was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe.

[A man and son watch the prisoners pull into town.]

should be here. It’s these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.

Ralof: We’re all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.

Imperial Soldier: Shut up back there!

[Lokir looks at the gagged man.]

Lokir: And what’s wrong with him?

Ralof: Watch your tongue! You’re speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High
King.

Lokir: Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You’re the leader of the rebellion. But if
they captured you… Oh gods, where are they taking us?

Ralof: I don’t know where we’re going, but Sovngarde awaits.

Lokir: No, this can’t be happening. This isn’t happening.

Ralof: Hey, what village are you from, horse thief?

Lokir: Why do you care?

Ralof: A Nord’s last thoughts should be of home.

Lokir: Rorikstead. I’m…I’m from Rorikstead.

[They approach the village of Helgen. A soldier calls out to the lead wagon.]

Imperial Soldier: General Tullius, sir! The headsman is waiting!

General Tullius: Good. Let’s get this over with.

Lokir: Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me.

Ralof: Look at him, General Tullius the Military Governor. And it looks like
the Thalmor are with him. D**n elves. I bet they had something to do
with this.

This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here. Wonder if Vilod
is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in. Funny…when I
was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe.

[A man and son watch the prisoners pull into town.]

Haming: Who are they, daddy? Where are they going?

Torolf: You need to go inside, little cub.

Haming: Why? I want to watch the soldiers.

Torolf: Inside the house. Now."

teenagers,I miss snow,"It's almost December and there still is no snow. It has been like this for couple of years.

I remember how there was snow on 18th November in capital city (because of cars and sea next to it, snow will melt quickly) 10 years ago. It should be at least few cm by now but that haven't been the situation for years.

Yesterday during night I saw how it was snowing and how the snow was staying on the ground. Today I wake up and guess what. No snow. Nada.

I miss having the snow piles that broke the old fence, ice on my street that made small kids fall to death (j), and evenings when the sky was orange and you could see big snow flakes falling.","I miss snow It's almost December and there still is no snow. It has been like this for couple of years.

teenagers,Please teenagers of Reddit I need your opinion on a short story I wrote and i want you too rate it for me. I am very proud of it.,"Just imagine your at home eating Thanksgiving dinner and it was about 8:00PM. As you were about to shut off the tv a target ad pops up on the screen talking about 50%-90% off deals on all items in the store you immediately get up and grab your coat and tent to camp right by the entrance of target so you can at least get some shut eye for the night. You get in your car and speed off into the fading moon of the night listening to Billy Joel on the radio. You arrive at Target and see there are also many campers around the entrance. You set up camp and at this point its about 8:45PM as you set an alarm for 4:00AM to have enough time to get ready in line for 5:00AM, the time they open the store. You close your eyes and drift off to sleep into the night. 

You wake up and look at the clock its about 4:56AM. You mumble under your breath ""Stupid Android, of course the alarm wouldn't go off."" You dit up and hear jingles from a few miles away. You unzip your tent and look outside and in the distance you see a heard of people running..infact there were billions of them. You get a closer look and all of them were dressed up as Santa Claus men, women, teenagers, kids everyone. You look inside the store and see a few Target employees, some standing bold and ready, some crying and hugging, others shooting their heads off. They knew they would die by the impact of a billion santa claus' running at full speed. As you looked back at your phone you realize it was 4:59. You looked back at the herd of Santa Claus'....it was time. The doors stuck open and immediately the crowd had disappeared into the store. You get a closer look and see all of the employees tumbled over and squished to death. You kneel to the blood soaked ground and starts crying infront of the entrance as you see kid Santa Claus' heads getting snapped and stepped on and women Santa Claus' hair getting pulled. Sooner or later the cops arrived but it was too late everyone was dead billions of Santa Claus'...all...dead. It was a riot.","Please teenagers of Reddit I need your opinion on a short story I wrote and i want you too rate it for me. I am very proud of it.

teenagers,Problem with friend groups,"As the title suggests, it just so happens that pretty much every ""friend group"" that I have gotten myself into always has people talking/criticizing others behind their backs. Is this just completely normal, as whenever someone doesn't hang out with the group, the discussion during the day is mainly negative topics regarding them. For example, problems that individuals have with them, and purely just things that aren't even remotely interesting. I say this as I find it quite repulsive that they even call each other friends, as sometimes people who call each other best friends will rant to me about things wrong with the other. I'm not sure if I'm just being overly observant, but it just completely bothers me and I just felt like putting it out there. Hopefully it's just that I happened to meet the wrong people.","Problem with friend groups As the title suggests, it just so happens that pretty much every ""friend group"" that I have gotten myself into always has people talking/criticizing others behind their backs.

teenagers,Just a little thing I want to experience.. also a test on my writing,"While you slowly awake you hear the gentle taps of rain hit the window, light barely creeping in and hitting you and another body cuddled up next to you. You look around the room while hearing the rain hit the roof and window while cuddled up under the blankets with your loved one, every second cherished and loved while you lay there while rubbing your eyes and sighed. Your eyes begin to slowly move around the room you are in, it is your bedroom but it seems more... decorated... things that you don't own nor remember getting. ""Hrmm.... still prettt early..."" you mutter to yourself and blink a few times before stretching and slowly lifting yourself up and grunted while still hearing the gentle rain before you looked at the one laying with you, smiling at them before giving a gentle kiss right on their cheek before slowly shifting to hug them tightly and cuddle back up before looking at the time and then looked back at your loved one while your eyes begin to shut, your eyes glued together from hoe tired you still felt while slowly drifting off to sleep again as you felt too relaxed, everything fading away while you trance back into a lovely dream.

Any thoughts? I made it so you can think of it in any position and the person could be a guy or girl :3","Just a little thing I want to experience.. also a test on my writing While you slowly awake you hear the gentle taps of rain hit the window, light barely creeping in and hitting you and another body cuddled up next to you.

teenagers,I still don’t understand how girls find me attractive,"I’ve had a couple girls that have found me attractive and I just don’t understand why anyone would chose me over somebody else, like

Cons:
• I’m really pale
• I’m really skinny 
• I have super dark bags under my eyes
• I’m really clumsy and awkward 
• I’m not very confident 
• I’m pretty socially awkward most of the time
• I’m only funny when I’m not trying to be so I’m usually not funny
• I’m pretty weak 
Pros:
• I have nice hair

That’s about it, it feels like people only like me for my personality so I guess that’s a good thing sometimes since it shows they actually care about who I am

Maybe I just hate myself or something so that’s why I question this idk","I still don’t understand how girls find me attractive I’ve had a couple girls that have found me attractive and I just don’t understand why anyone would chose me over somebody else, like

teenagers,Story of how I got out of going to school for a month,"So basically I go to a school as a student. I’m in the 10th grade and currently we’re doing 4 classes and 2 semesters. At the end of the 2nd semester of my classes I’m supposed to get another 4 classes but something happened lol. Let’s go back in time to about November 16, 2020 12:00AM. That day I fought the wither under my cousin’s house in Minecraft and we almost got our entire base destroyed. After staying up until about 6:00AM that day I realized I had school in like 2 hours and 30 minutes. After school I had about 8 assignments (2 per class) but I decided to blow them off and take a power nap...this didn’t end too well. I slept for over 5 hours that day and woke up at around 7:00PM and decided that I was going to procrastinate my schoolwork and instead I started watching anime. After that day I continued to miss work but I sort of made up all of my work in everyone class expect for one; wOrLd HiStOrY. I soon realized that I did not give one fuck due to the fact that I was already being overloaded with a lot of work as it was. Fast forward to November 25th, 2020 8:32AM. I woke up late for class and my mom literally would kill me if I ever decided to over sleep so I kind of panicked and I quickly opened up my school device and logged on to get into my class when I see that the app my county used for schooling was down. I was confused and then all of a sudden my mom burst into my room warning me that my school’s website was hacked and not to touch my school computer because it might have a virus on it. I needed a scapegoat to get out of doing all those missing assignments so I celebrate for about 5 minutes but then I realized I literally had just opened my school computer so now my computer is probably done for. My school will probably be unable to fix this for a month they believe so I guess I’ll just have a lot of free time until then.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯","Story of how I got out of going to school for a month So basically I go to a school as a student.

teenagers,I have a weird problem: almost everyone who finds me cute is younger than me bc I have a young face,"So it seems like most girls like dudes that are older than them but even though I’m 18 I legit look 16. I’m in 12th grade and freshmen and sophomores sometimes hit on me but I’d only be willing to date a junior. Like it just sucks ass knowing I’m attractive to people I can’t date, it’s like why tf can’t people my age flirt with me? This young face thing will pay off later in life but rn it just sucks ass lol. I just hate the fact that I have confirmation that I am at least conventionally attractive to a degree but it doesn’t accomplish anything for me bc I look too young. Like part of the reason I’m alone is out of my control and it’s just fhdjddndkdjdj. Idk, I’ll find someone eventually hopefully bc I haven’t been focused on entering a relationship at all recently and now I am again but uggh. I’m def not dating a freshmen this year and I’m really hesitant with going into anything with a sophomore (there’s Romeo and Juliet law here so it’s okay, it just has to be within 3 years but it feels too weird) so hopefully I find a junior that’s into me lol. I just want a relationship for my last stretch of high school and wanna have some fun while I’m still a “kid” and times running out. Ig I have to do the flirting which I really don’t know how to do and am uncomfortable with lol. This is pain I hate having hope and confidence bc it sets up disappointment","I have a weird problem: almost everyone who finds me cute is younger than me bc I have a young face So it seems like most girls like dudes that are older than them but even though I’m 18 I legit look 16.

teenagers,"You live under a system of servitude, which is why ""freedom"" propaganda is so prevalent","I've probably made a post like this in the past, but I don't care because this is important. The word freedom and the word servitude both have definitions. When I was a teenager, I truly wish an adult looked me in the eyes, and explained this simple truth to me, so as an adult, I'm going to explain it to whoever is reading this. 

The definition of [servitude](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/freedom) is ""a condition in which one lacks liberty especially to determine one's course of action or way of life""

The definition of [freedom](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/freedom) is ""the absence of necessity, coercion, or constraint in choice or action""

Every human you have ever met lives under Capitalism, and you will be taking part in it or else. This, by definition, means you are under a system of servitude, the opposite of a system of freedom or free choice. 

I'm not making an argument, I'm simply explaining to you that words mean things. They have definitions. You don't have to like it, you don't have to agree, because again, it's not an argument. Like I said, I wish as a teenager a adult told me the truth, but that never happened. It would have helped me a lot to know that at least someone has a grasp of what is going on and was able to explain it in such a simple way.

Instead of the truth, I was, like so many of us, lied to by economic propaganda and the victims of that propaganda. I was never sat down and told that no, I don't live in a free country, and I most likely will not in my lifetime, and I really, really wish someone would have told me that. I hate the fact that I had to learn that as an adult. 

If someone tells you they live in a free country, they are accidentally lying to you. You're not special, your country is not special, it is no more or less free than anywhere else. You live under the same system of economic servitude as North Koreans. If someone tries to convince you that you live in a free country, I would not take life advice from them. I'm not saying treat them poorly, they are victims of propaganda, and you should feel bad for them and try to educate them in an attempt to ""break the spell."" 

Don't let lies win, don't let propaganda win. Tell the truth, tell your kids the truth. Tell as many people young and old as you can the truth. I know it's uncomfortable to accept this fact, but it's very important that as many people know the truth as possible, otherwise the world will continue the way it is, and if you care about humanity, you know we can't allow that.","You live under a system of servitude, which is why ""freedom"" propaganda is so prevalent I've probably made a post like this in the past, but I don't care because this is important.

So me and my friends were sitting at my old elementary school (idk y that’s just we’re we chose to hangout)they were all hammered as fuck I hadn’t had anything to drink bc I wasn’t with them before when they were drinking. I snuck out at like 12 to go hangout with them. Anyway they were being so loud and as we were leaving to go  back to my friends house the cops pulled up so I ran my ass across the school yard jumped a fence into someone’s yard went out that persons gate and sprinted home. interesting night. Also side note think I broke my pinky when I hopped the fence","So I just had an interesting experience

teenagers,How do I get over someone from high school,"TL;DR: got a crush on a girl I kind of knew, haven't seen or talked to her at all in around 8 months but I still think I have feelings for her despite knowing I probably won't get to see her again


Basically, last year in high school I met this girl in a class of mine, and we would sometimes talk to each other. She was really nice and it was never anything more than her being friendly. But,, being deprived of pretty much any female attention, I ended up getting feelings for her because that's just what happens when you don't talk to girls often. 

For a while we kind of ended up talking a little more but then we kind of drifted apart and didn't talk as much. We never got to talking outside of school or anything so we weren't really friends, but it did kind of suck. However, I didn't really stop feeling for her. I was hoping we would be able to talk some more as the year finished out but then covid hit and we haven't talked at all since (because we never got to talking outside of school so I didn't have her contact info). At that point I was just trying to be friends with her though.

For a while I didn't really think of her all that much but recently I'm starting to think I never really stopped liking her, since I've been thinking about her more often than usual. I don't know why; we haven't spoken or seen each other since March so it should have been long enough to get over her but if I somehow saw her again I  would probably fall flat.

I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I can't tell her how I feel for multiple reasons. And I don't think I could meet anyone else that would take my mind off of her (which would also kind of be unethical). I'll also probably never get to see her or talk to her again, so there's no real reason for me to be feeling this way. I figured all this time would be enough to move on but I can't seem to. How do I get over her?","How do I get over someone from high school TL;DR: got a crush on a girl I kind of knew, haven't seen or talked to her at all in around 8 months but I still think I have feelings for her despite knowing I probably won't get to see her again

teenagers,"I got caught making out with my gf by her dad, and im fucking terrified. We're Christian.","Backstory here:

Me and my girlfriend have been dating for two months as of this (early) morning. I just got home and its almost 2 am. 

Our families are both Christian, and we go to a Christian private school, etc. Needless to say, any sort of sexual shit is the end of the world to our parents. 

We agreed to not have sex when we started dating, and to not go overboard on any physicality in our relationship. Making out was something we didn't consider to be wrong at all. We would do it fairly often when we'd say goodbye after hanging out late at night. 

This is where we fucked up. 

I was driving her home about 11:30. Her parents always wanted her home around midnight, but it was the weekend and they hadn't told us a time to have her home. My parents don't really care when I'm home. We decided to go to Whataburger on the way. After we ate and were sitting in the parking lot we decided to make out. But we went further than before.

After a little while, she took her top off, I took my shirt off and we kept making out. We didn't really go any further than that. I never took my dick out, and she never bothered with it (it was our first time doing going this far).  We even kept looking to see if any of our parents texted each us to say to come home. Even though they didn't say anything, we got carried away and kept going instead of deciding to go home at some point (which was fucking stupid).

At 1:30 her dad suddenly knocks on the window, tells us to get our clothes on, and go the fuck home. My parents were asleep when I got back, but I'm sure that conversation's gonna be miserable. I'm not sure what the consequences are going to be, but no way do they let us keep dating. I'm not really worried about if I end up grounded, but if they don't even let us text or anything it's gonna be miserable. 

Anyway, thats the story. Fucking help me. I don't know how I'm going to tell my parents when they wake up, but as long as I can explain it before her parents talk to mine, I might come out okay? I don't know.  

Advice would be appreciated. I'm happy to clarify any details. Thanks!","I got caught making out with my gf by her dad, and im fucking terrified. We're Christian. Backstory here:

teenagers,After some thinking I've finally concluded why it is I hate the JoJo fan base with a passion,"They infest everything they touch like the goddamn plague and try to link it to jojo in some way and most be will just be sitting there like ""haha yeah cool man but can we talk about the story of [insert show here] and not a jojo meme"" and they'll keep talking about it all the fucking time and the memes are the most repetitive bullshit



I also just saw this really good video of this dude talking about why it is art teachers dislike anime art and he said the teachers understand not everyone wants to draw big muscular men and some fucking scholar got top comment by saying ""Oh jUsT drAW jOJo iTs a mIx"" by saying this you just took all of this dude's advice and all his work he put into the video and said ""no I'm lazy and want to draw jojo so fuck you and literally everything you said""



The day the jojo fan base isn't like this anymore I may try to interact with them in some way but until that day I'll avoid them like carrion on the road though that may be difficult as my school is infested with the little fuckers and once I go back to normal school I'll have to see them every day","After some thinking I've finally concluded why it is I hate the JoJo fan base with a passion They infest everything they touch like the goddamn plague and try to link it to jojo in some way and most be will just be sitting there like ""haha yeah cool man but can we talk about the story of [insert show here] and not a jojo meme"" and they'll keep talking about it all the fucking time and the memes are the most repetitive bullshit

teenagers,"I was forced to leave everything I cared about nearly 5 years ago. My home, my friends, my pets, my family... everything...","But now, the thing that was stopping me coming home... it's finally gone. 

Everything's changed so much...

My furballs are in a better place, the house is a mess bc family was gonna move so I could live with them again (this was before the thing keeping me away was gone), all the peoppe I knew around here moved, and things are hectic around the house.

But no matter what, I'm happy to finally be home. 

The entire time I'd been away, I'd considered ending my life. Living without my cats, the friends I grew up with, was extremely hard.

For the last 2.5 years I was stuck living with a horrible father. He refused to teach me any basic life skills, and didn't want to spend a penny more than he had to on me.

The first ~2.5 years were spent in motels and in... places I'd rather not mention

Not even a week after I left town to the second location I was stuck at, I received a phone call that my best friend had passed. I didn't leave my room or eat meals for nearly a week due to how grief stricken I was. That's how much he meant to me

But i fought on, for him. A good chunk of my childhood was ruined, but I stayed determined for his sake. He may have been there every day for me the early years of my life, but I'm not going to let that go to waste.

Being home will never feel the same without him, but the memories of him will live on forever.

Even so, at least being home, I can start getting my life back in track. Being set back this far has taken a huge toll on me. I have no basic life skills. I didn't even have the chance to teach myself anything.

I hope you're all having as good a week as I am. Nothing feels better than being able to finally go home, especially right after Thanksgiving.

If you read through everything, thank you. 

I doubt anyone has ever had to suffer through anything similar to what I've been through. Everyone's struggles are different. But if anyone knows what it feels like to come home after so long... at least they'd know why i felt the need to post this.

TL;DR: after nearly 5 years, I was finally able to come home. I may not have the same life as I would if I wasn't forced to leave, but I can still get my life back in track in the right place.","I was forced to leave everything I cared about nearly 5 years ago.

teenagers,Here's your Alternative life!,"Here's your Alternative life:

U r born into a rich household, you spend your childhood on a velvet golden pillow, but it's not as glamorous as your freinds and schoolmates think. You are constantly striving for your parents approval, because no matter how hard you try to accomplish something great, you'll never be able to be compared to their golden legacies. After years of working hard, you graduate highschool with a 4.0 gpa.

     After highschool, you spiral into depression. You got accepted into harvard, but feel as though you don't have the same motivation as you used to. You flunk within the first semester, and now your parents are truly disappointed in you, you thought you were a failure before? Well oh boy that was nothing compared to this. Your parents kick you out of the mansion, and strip you of your credit cards. 

     Now, you are forced to work for yourself. No longer are you striving for your parents approval, now you're just trying to pay the bills. You get a job at a car dealership, where you get to convince rich people into buying even richer cars. You love your new job, it's fun to watch sad people throw their money at cars as if it will solve their unfulfilled lives.

    There's a cute person at the dealership. You two like to team up to get people to buy the most expensive sports cars.

   You ask the cute person out, and within four months, you're engaged.

   Fast forward 3 years, and you and your spouse have a baby on the way. For the first time in 4 years you reach out to your parents, and they are actually happy to hear from you, they want to reconnect. You agree to come to the mansion once the baby is born for them to see. 

     Once they see the baby, they immediately love it. They want you, the baby and your spouse, to move into the mansion. 

    You and your spouse, discuss it, and decide to decline their offer you're happy, and don't want to be corrupted by money 

   Fast forward ten years. You are happy, your child is 10 now, and is as smart and beautiful. And your marriage is thriving. Financially you are okay, and slowing saving for your kids college.

  In five years, you get a call that shakes you. Your parents were in an accident, and everything was left to you.

    You take your kid and spouse to the mansion for the funeral. Once their your kid begs to stay. So you move into the mansion.
 
    You attend fancy parties, your kid goes to a fancy school, and youre miserable.

    After 5 years, your spouse cheats, but you stay together for your kid.

    Welp... It's been who the fuck knows how many years now. You are divorced from your wife... And your kids in college, Harvard to be exact. Fun fact, your wife actually married one of the rich kids you grew up with.

   And this is where your story ends. Sounds incomplete, doesn't it? Well most unfulfilled lives are.

(If the editing is bad, it's cause I wrote this in like 15 mins)","Here's your Alternative life! Here's your Alternative life:

U r born into a rich household, you spend your childhood on a velvet golden pillow, but it's not as glamorous as your freinds and schoolmates think. You are constantly striving for your parents approval, because no matter how hard you try to accomplish something great, you'll never be able to be compared to their golden legacies. After years of working hard, you graduate highschool with a 4.0 gpa.

     After highschool, you spiral into depression. You got accepted into harvard, but feel as though you don't have the same motivation as you used to. You flunk within the first semester, and now your parents are truly disappointed in you, you thought you were a failure before? Well oh boy that was nothing compared to this. Your parents kick you out of the mansion, and strip you of your credit cards. 

     Now, you are forced to work for yourself. No longer are you striving for your parents approval, now you're just trying to pay the bills. You get a job at a car dealership, where you get to convince rich people into buying even richer cars. You love your new job, it's fun to watch sad people throw their money at cars as if it will solve their unfulfilled lives.

    There's a cute person at the dealership. You two like to team up to get people to buy the most expensive sports cars.

   You ask the cute person out, and within four months, you're engaged.

   Fast forward 3 years, and you and your spouse have a baby on the way. For the first time in 4 years you reach out to your parents, and they are actually happy to hear from you, they want to reconnect. You agree to come to the mansion once the baby is born for them to see.

Fourth, Ask her/him out.
Here’s the thing, if she/he says yes, you don’t pull out ur phone till he/she leaves. But other than that, congrats :D.

If she/he says no, pull out your phone and say it was a prank and you’ve been going around doing that to random people,

teenagers,I realized recently that I’m not as alone as I thought I was,"When I was 10 I was diagnosed for ADHD, which explained why I had trouble focusing on things. But I hadn’t realized until recently that it had also caused a few other problems. When I was diagnosed my parents didn’t treat it seriously and had barely done anything to help, which had also made me think that it wasn’t really an issue. Throughout middle school my grades were straight D’s and C’s, and my parents weren’t helping me in anyway and instead lectured me everyday on how I was being Irresponsible (which was mostly true) which had caused me to be very stressed already. My social life wasn’t much better either, I constantly felt like I was talking too much and felt like people didn’t like talking to me, eventually I grew a habit of saying sorry after every time I was talking to someone and felt like I annoyed them, which I ended up doing a lot. I had also had trouble with mood swings which would commonly make people look at me as if I was an immature child and had made me feel extremely excluded. This continued for 4 years and before I was diagnosed. 

A week ago I was browsing youtube and saw a video of tiktoks talking about ADHD. I click on it and start watching it, I watch and see people talking about their troubles with ADHD. I had felt a strong relief and before I knew It I was crying. For so long I had thought that a lot of the things that I had been having trouble with was my own personality. I thought that there had been something wrong with me the entire time and when I saw these people having the same problem as me, it made me realize I’m not alone.

I know a lot of you don’t care, but please treat ADHD as a real mental illness, not as something that can make you “quirky” or have “crack head energy” It is a real issue and should be treated as one.

TL;DR I had ADHD it caused problems for me that I thought was personal but found out it was part of ADHD, And take ADHD serious.","I realized recently that I’m not as alone as I thought I was When I was 10 I was diagnosed for ADHD, which explained why I had trouble focusing on things.

One guy sends me a video of him pissing into the toilet, another one was so self loathing that I couldn't handle it anymore (not to mention how he used that to try and manipulate me), also just dealing with fuckbois from highschool. Like no wonder why I keep questioning my sexuality when these are the type of men attracted to me. 

BRUH SENDING ME A VIDEO OF YOU PISSING, FOR WHY.

teenagers,Is this my fault,There's a girl I go to school with who I've liked for a while so I decided to tell her I like her. This was a couple years ago. She told me she liked me as well so we started dating. I have never been in a relationship so this was new to me. After a week or so I started getting uncomfortable and didn't feel ready to date I guess. I told her this and we broke up but were still friends. About a month ago I started to feel like I was ready so I told her how I felt now and why we broke up. She friendzoned me basically.

teenagers,"I lost faith in humanity when I was in grade 1, and just wanted to get a weight off my chest.","Ok, so story time, when I was in grade 1, they had these things in happy meals, that were like little cute animals, they went into a ball, and when you pushed a button they would pop up into a animal. I was so proud of my collection and brought them to school for show and tell, and then I dropped them on the bus. They rolled all the way to the back where the grade 8s sat, and by the time the bus stopped they had all been taken. I told the bus driver and she asked the kids to give them back, but no one fessed up, and to this day that has been a horrible feeling. I have no clue why a full grown teenage would see a cheap plastic toy, and know that they had taken it from a small kid, and still not give it back.","I lost faith in humanity when I was in grade 1, and just wanted to get a weight off my chest.

teenagers,So my girlfriend broke up with my in the most assholeish way...,"Let me explain what happened. So her and I had been dating for about a month, we saw each other a lot, almost every day. At one point during our second month, we were laying together watching Pewds, and her face got red when she stood up, and she asked if she could see my abs. Quick little note here, I work at a mall quite often and only get to workout, every couple of days in the week and she knows this. She covered her face as I lifted my shirt, she looked and saw my somewhat sixpack. She immediately frowned, I asked her what she thought, she shrugged and barely talked to me while she was at my house. She left an hour later.

She texted me a day later, breaking up with me. I was upset and asked what I did wrong.  She said it was because she was pissed that I didn't really have abs. I was a bit shocked. 

Now heres the shitty part. Flash forward to 1 month later, her friends notice we weren't talking. She then started to spread the rumor that I cheated on her, because I was telling her friends what actually happened and I imagine she said that  to her friends so she didn't look like a dick. 
Many other girls have rejected me and won't talk to me now. She's ruined my social life and my chances with other girls.","So my girlfriend broke up with my in the most assholeish way...

teenagers,I’m 17 and feel like garbage,"This is mostly for myself to vent, but figured you guys might relate to my situation. Basically everything in my life has been feeling pretty hopeless lately. Girlfriend of 10 months who I loved to death dumped me about a month ago and I’ve felt so lonely since. Been trying to hang out with the few people I consider friends but it feels like none of them want to be around me, I’m always the one making plans. I look around and I feel like everyone has people to confide in and have people that actually enjoy their company. I just want at least one person to have a connection with on a deeper level. My parents don’t help the situation, as they’re constantly hounding me about my grades (For context, I’m usually a straight A student but now I’ve got a few Bs). With Covid every day feels the same, waste time on useless video classes and go to work. Rinse and repeat. Been trying to keep up with my hobbies but most days I don’t have the motivation to and end up watching YouTube for hours. Stepdad is an ass and won’t even let me take drivers Ed, much less get my license, so can’t really leave the house. I know I’ll be going to college in another state once I graduate, but feel like I have no purpose. Basically just really lost right now.","I’m 17 and feel like garbage This is mostly for myself to vent, but figured you guys might relate to my situation.

teenagers,My Dumb mother,"So you guys remember that whole anti-vaxxer craze where 40 year old women wouldn’t want special fluid put into their child through a needle? Well after that died down I was chilling in my kitchen drinking a cup of water, as I do. Then my mother walked in and I started chatting about how scientists are working on a cure, then my dad comes in and says that if the COVID vaccine is ready he’ll get it in December because he’s in the Army. Then my mother starts talking about how she doesn’t trust the vaccine and we both look at her like, “Bruh.” I asked her why she doesn’t trust it and she says that vaccines cause Autism. At the time I didn’t think that my mother was really like this, I thought she was just a normal Joe and supported vaccination. But no, this came as a surprise to me and my dad. (Obviously) Then we both started hitting her with cold hard facts then my brother walks in and tells up to shut the hell up, after telling my brother what happened we all started hitting her with fax. But she kept being stubborn and wouldn’t accept the idea that vaccines don’t cause Autism. After all that she was pissed at all of us because we thought the same thing. 

Don’t know if anyone cares but I just wanted to share this, have a good one. (:","My Dumb mother So you guys remember that whole anti-vaxxer craze where 40 year old women wouldn’t want special fluid put into their child through a needle? Well after that died down I was chilling in my kitchen drinking a cup of water, as I do. Then my mother walked in and I started chatting about how scientists are working on a cure, then my dad comes in and says that if the COVID vaccine is ready he’ll get it in December because he’s in the Army. Then my mother starts talking about how she doesn’t trust the vaccine and we both look at her like, “Bruh.” I asked her why she doesn’t trust it and she says that vaccines cause Autism. At the time I didn’t think that my mother was really like this, I thought she was just a normal Joe and supported vaccination. But no, this came as a surprise to me and my dad. (Obviously) Then we both started hitting her with cold hard facts then my brother walks in and tells up to shut the hell up, after telling my brother what happened we all started hitting her with fax. But she kept being stubborn and wouldn’t accept the idea that vaccines don’t cause Autism. After all that she was pissed at all of us because we thought the same thing. 

Don’t know if anyone cares but I just wanted to share this, have a good one. (:"

teenagers,i think i have panic disorder,"and i don’t know how to tell my parents. i’m a 13M and yday i had my worst panic attack yet. i stayed outside on the street sort of just sitting there, but mainly pacing around during the panic attack. i had lied to my mom about going for a run so that i could get out of my house. i ended up staying outside for like 1.5 hours, and my mom came out and talked about shit like “parents are here to help you” and “you can trust me” and i was like i’m not comfortable telling your rn. and then my mom was like, pressuring me into telling her, tot he point where i was on the verge of tears. and then i decided, ok i’ll tell you sometime next week. about 1 minute after my mom went in, my sister came out and said the same shit. then i was like, why are you out here did mom tell you to come out? and she bullshited me and said, “well what are you doing?” i was like, i’m staring at the ground doing nothing. then she was like “well i’m doing the same thing.” guys, what am i supposed to pick up from this? that i’m not alone? i honestly don’t know. i was like, can you leave me alone? she was like no. then i was like ok then i’m gonna go inside. at this point my panic attack was over but i was still feeling the effects (dizziness, trembling, etc). so i went up to my room and closed the door as gently as possible. at this point i don’t know what the fuck i’m gonna do. my friends were at their house eating thanksgiving dinner, i didn’t really want to interrupt but it got to the point where the panic attack was severe enough i felt like i
had to call them. so i text them a bunch. turns out they can’t find their phone. so i text the other sibling. i tell her to tell the friend i first texted to check her phone. that’s when i learn that the first sibling lost her phone. at this point i’m scared for my damned life, so i contact the final sibling. (to clear things up, i wanted to say that the second sibling i texted wasn’t as close to me as the first and third sibling, which is why i decided not to tell her). anyways, i contact the final sibling, and they have finished the dinner and stuff. so, i told sibling three i just had my worst panic attack. (sibling one and three know that i had panic attacks before). so i ask them to come out just for support, and sibling one and three come rushing out, and god damn i needed that. i guess what i’m trying to say here is that my friends saved me. it’s not like i was thinking about suicide, but it was that i was scared. i didn’t know how much longer i could go on my own. anyways, they hug me. fuck. i needed that bad. moving on from yday, i just had another attack today (a couple hours ago) and a few hours before that my mom gave me a lecture about growing up, which i assume has to do with her coming to sit with me outside yesterday. so yeah she gave me a lecture, and i’m just having none of it. and on top of that, she said video games were making me “depressed” and i should stop to be less “depressed”. there are multiple things wrong with this to me. 1) she automatically assumed after yday i was depressed 2) that video games were causing my so called “depression”, but in reality video games are actually an outlet for me, something to communicate with old friends, something to distract me from what i think is my panic disorder. 
anyways, now i don’t know how/whether to tell my parents that i think i have panic disorder, bc my mom is really dumb (there is no other way to put it) about mental illnesses. 

SORRY!!! i had to vent for a while cuz i don’t really want my amazing friends to have to deal with more, they’re balancing their own busy lives with helping me. 

tldr: had my worst panic attack yday, i think i have panic disorder, and now i’m debating whether to tell my parents i think i have panic disorder.","i think i have panic disorder and i don’t know how to tell my parents. i’m a 13M and yday i had my worst panic attack yet. i stayed outside on the street sort of just sitting there, but mainly pacing around during the panic attack. i had lied to my mom about going for a run so that i could get out of my house. i ended up staying outside for like 1.5 hours, and my mom came out and talked about shit like “parents are here to help you” and “you can trust me” and i was like i’m not comfortable telling your rn. and then my mom was like, pressuring me into telling her, tot he point where i was on the verge of tears. and then i decided, ok i’ll tell you sometime next week. about 1 minute after my mom went in, my sister came out and said the same shit. then i was like, why are you out here did mom tell you to come out? and she bullshited me and said, “well what are you doing?” i was like, i’m staring at the ground doing nothing. then she was like “well i’m doing the same thing.” guys, what am i supposed to pick up from this? that i’m not alone? i honestly don’t know. i was like, can you leave me alone? she was like no. then i was like ok then i’m gonna go inside. at this point my panic attack was over but i was still feeling the effects (dizziness, trembling, etc). so i went up to my room and closed the door as gently as possible. at this point i don’t know what the fuck i’m gonna do. my friends were at their house eating thanksgiving dinner, i didn’t really want to interrupt but it got to the point where the panic attack was severe enough i felt like i

teenagers,Why should I hide my feelings?,"Hi, my name’s Alan and I’m 16. I have a question for you. Why boys should hide their feelings? At first look I live in normal family: mom, dad, sister etc. But I am absolutely alone. I have no friends, the last one died form brain cancer 5 years ago. I’m being bullied at school, no one likes me but I am always trying to make someone’s life better. Maybe just a little bit maybe more. But even my parents don’t love me. They say that as I get 18 they’ll throw me out of their house because I've already been around their necks. They say they gave me a roof over my head and food, to pay for the rest: training, new clothes and God forbid some costly hobbies. I started working at the age of 14, it's possible in my country and kept everything for myself, while my sister was bought everything from new phone models to snowboarding uniforms for $2,500, although she was just starting to skate then. She's groomed and cherished while I have to survive. I understand that there are people in poor countries who live worse than me, but at least I had the opportunity to get better and help others, but by coincidence it doesn't happen. Many people will say that I dissolve snot and I'm mentally weak, but that's your opinion, I accept it as the opinion of a person I don't know and he lamented a ton of my whining, having lost a lot of time, I'll tell you, ""Make yourself a cup of hot chocolate and relax, I think you can afford this”.

teenagers,Oh god i clogged the toilet twice at my brothers house,"So me and my family went to my brothers house for thanksgiving and my birthday(which were on the same day), there was a total of 5 people. Me, my mom, my dad, my brother and my pregnant sister in law. My parents and brother left to go walk the dog so it was just me and my preg sister in law in the house when I suddenly had to take a shit. So I take a shit and I flush and it clogs. It wasnt even a big shit. Im standin there not knowing what to do because 1, the only other person in the house is my preg sister in law taking a nap who I didnt want to wake up and 2, I have never used a plunger before and I have a fear of messing up really simple tasks. So eventually my sister wakes up, comes down stairs and sees me standing outside the bathroom with a worried look, at this point the water is starting to sink back down a bit. After a couple minutes of my sister making jokes that I can’t plunge a toliet she plunges it and goes back to bed. The next morning I wake up and need to take another shit. Not trusting the downstairs toliet I used last time I decided to use the one upstairs. So im done taking the shit, wipe and flush and you won’t guess what happens next, this one also clogs. God. Fucking. Dammit. Again, not a big shit, hell most of it wasnt even solid. Its about 6:15, pretty early and no one is up. I think to myself that I could probably handle this and no one needs to know. I wait for the water to recide a bit then I head down stairs, grab the plunger and head back up to see my mom,half asleep, standing in front of the bathroom with a “are you serious” kinda look. She wakes up my dad to teach me how to plunge while she goes back to sleep. My dad teaches me how, saying I gotta plunge slowly or else im gonna cause a shit tsunami which is good advice because knowing me I was gonna plunge like im playing a button masher. So after that they went back to bed. It wasnt untill later my mom realised how funny it was and started telling everybody else. Thanks mom, love you. So now everone will remember my 16th birthday as the time I clogged both toliets at my brothers house.","Oh god i clogged the toilet twice at my brothers house So me and my family went to my brothers house for thanksgiving and my birthday(which were on the same day), there was a total of 5 people.

teenagers,I hate my luck...,"Well recently I’ve been having extremely bad luck, like my brother who is bringing me a computer from the US just got COVID so he now has to quarantine himself.

An to top that off my Nintendo switch just got stolen along with my phone charger and six Nintendo switch games(Some asshole stole my bag while I was traveling).

I always tried hard but I can't, i feel that is impossible to me learn this language. I watched every tutorial in YouTube, talking with natives american, watch a movie, but idk. Its horribly hear someone from your school that have less years in USA and talk perfectly in english with your teacher, with his friends and be a perfect student I.. think i will never be successful, i will never going to a college, get a good job, talk to a girl, or just have a normal conversation with someone in english.

teenagers,Group projects are always a bad idea,"So, kind of a long story but around 3 weeks ago a school wide group project started. The theme was math games and programming one.
    And me, my friend(lets call him Peter) and 2 other people (let's call them Richard and Lisa) who I don't know pretty well teamed up for the project. We got assigned our roles and I got assigned frontend, which is basically to make everything look good.
    There was only one problem: I only know how to use git and program in c++ pretty well (well for my age) and we decided to program the game in c++.
    Naturally I decided to start doing the project because nobody was starting on it. I called up Peter and I started programming while he keeps me sane.
    1 week passes. 2 weeks pass. Lisa hasn't even appeared in any of the group meetings except the first one. I decided to take things into my own hands and I assigned some work to everybody, even though I am not the project leader(Peter is). I gave documentation to Peter and Richard and the presentation to Lisa.
    Well documentation is done, but we still don't have the presentation ready. For the presentation we need to record our voices and make it into a little video but thats pretty hard when you don't have one.
     The presentation of the projects in on the coming Wednesday and I think I will have to do all the work on it.","Group projects are always a bad idea So, kind of a long story but around 3 weeks ago a school wide group project started. The theme was math games and programming one.

teenagers,Finally got a girlfriend!,"So I’m at a new school and I got in a friend group with a lot of girls. So obviously as a new kid and a guy I was being really nice to those that befriended me first so I was really nice to this one girl and people were saying I liked her when I didn’t. 

We’ll skip to tonight where I’ve had this crush on this one girl in the friend group for around a month now. She invited me to this discord server and we were all chatting and soon we were using one of the ship commands from a bot and it kept saying me and that girl were around 90%. So obviously the other members pushed us into a relationship and we went to DMs to find out. 

Turns out she liked me for weeks and liked me because I was attractive and nice. Really did help my self esteem and now I have a girlfriend. Though we do have to stay quiet because anything spreads like wildfire when grades are ~50 people.

TL, DR; My crush invited me to this server and a bot command encouraged other members into both of us figuring out we actually liked the other.","Finally got a girlfriend!

teenagers,Well I was just diagnosed with Tourette’s Syndrome,"  So on Thursday I went to the neurologist because I’ve had tics for 5-6 years, and it was confirmed that it’s Tourette’s. Tourette’s is NOT defined by coprolalia, which is the version on the spectrum where people swear. People really misunderstand TS and it’s really looked down upon. 
  Mine is only a simple case. TS is a spectrum disorder that ranges from small things like head jerking, to jumping up and down. TS is really only defined socially by the more uncommon and severe versions, when it isn’t the case. 
  Honestly TS is really misunderstood because of the media and I really just want to bring awareness to it because whenever I mention I have Tourette’s now, people keep asking if I jump up and down all the time or swear involuntarily, and it’s really frustrating that that’s automatically what people think of. Also it’s really annoying. Within like 3 days I’ve had like 50 people ask me the same thing.

Please don’t be one of those people, and help bring awareness to TS.","Well I was just diagnosed with Tourette’s Syndrome   So on Thursday I went to the neurologist because I’ve had tics for 5-6 years, and it was confirmed that it’s Tourette’s.

teenagers,Anyone thought about if they want a child or boy or girl,"Baby/gender

Before I start I understand every single reply is gonna be ""maybe try therapy"" or to heal myself before. I am not saying I am ready to have a baby now, but I feel it would be ahrd for me to accept myself not having a girl and I have never EVER in my life one single time that I can list have ever truly received anything I have wanted when it has been up to God/up to fate or chance. I struggled with gender dysphoria and having a period and went on birth control to stop it (Junel Fe 1/30) and it stopped it but obviously if I want to have a baby I will come off of it. Aren't women who come off the pill more likely to have sons due to the musuc/thickening of the musuc in the vagina. I know that the pill keeps the mucus thick and my ovulations would be more intense after coming off the pill and most boys are born during ovulation time. AGAIN i am not looking for ""go to therapy"" or to figure out my deep psycological feelings before having a baby and I AM NOT PLANNING ON HAVING A BABY ANY TIME SOON!!! But I would still like to know and the thought plagues me pretty constantly. Are people on birth control long term more likely to have boys or girls? I might add both my mother and father go girl first then boy. My mother was born first then my uncle and my aunt was blorn first and then my father. Either way I have these thoughts constantly.","Anyone thought about if they want a child or boy or girl Baby/gender

teenagers,I feel like I don't deserve the air in my lungs,"I've been a bit down lately and rightfully so. I am trapped in a lot of situations (and some are my fault) and I just don't feel like I can just pick up and keep moving.

I made two stupid mistakes at work that out me on thin ice with my boss, I've been struggling to keep up with college work, the girl who I've had feelings for for a very long time would never reciprocate them, and I'm turning 18 in two weeks which means I'm a legal adult and I don't think I'm deserving of that title.

I don't think I'll ever take my own life. My family had a history of suicide and I just don't think I could add more grief. Maybe it's clinical and genetic or psychologists say that greif can be heriditary, but I'm not diagnosed so I can't take medicine. Might go in to get tested once I turn 18 cause it'll be my choice and my choice alone. Might also get tested to see if I'm on the spectrum cause it is entirely possible.

Anyways lately I've just been sitting up in my room hating myself and getting that feeling in your stomach when you know you're doomed. It's gotten to the point where I just need to get away but I can't because of Covid. I'm working on getting my license and I'm halfway done with my driving hours and then I can take a road test but for the next month I'm trapped and it's gonna be a painful month.

I also feel bad for wanting to get away because my mom's dad had that same philosophy and just up and left without even telling anyone. Both sides of my family have a history of scumbag guys or guys without prospects. It seems my dad's the only man on either side of my family who isn't scummy but he can be a real asshole sometimes. I've tried my whole life to avoid being an asshole and try being a good person and I feel as if I succeded at that, but very little else. I'm becoming my uncles and I'm terrified.

I've tried therapy and it didn't help (mainly cause they were a spiritual therapist that my mom picked). I just wanna get tested for clinical depression and possibly autism or aspbergers as well, but again I gotta wait and even then I wouldn't have a ride until I get my license. 

I'm just at an awkward spot in my life in the most awkward part of modern history and I just can't wait fot it to be over.","I feel like I don't deserve the air in my lungs I've been a bit down lately and rightfully so.

Gender dysphoria 

My personal discovery that I'm trans

Transitioning

How dysphoria can affect mental health

The difference between trans people in porn and in real life

teenagers,Am I spoiled?,"Before I start I know that this problem as a whole is a spoiled problem, but I just need some help clearing my conscious.

Some context:

My uncle recently sold one of his cars because he did not need it anymore. He decided to be a saint and send all of his nieces and nephews $500 giving the reason that COVID had been rough and hopefully this helps. This money gave me and idea. I casually mentioned to my parents that I wanted to build a new gaming PC with the money I had just been given and some of my other saved money. This was supposed to be a joke and I was expecting it to be denied and that would be that. But they said yes and even offered to chip for an early Hanukkah gift from them and my grandparents. I would use the 500 and they would chip in the rest. Once I learned this I made 2 PCs online. One was $1000 and this was the one I was planning on getting. The other was $2000 dollars and this was a joke that I was dreaming of getting. I showed my parents both and they offered to pay $1500 dollars while I pay $500 dollars. 

The problem:

IDK what it is but this doesn't sit well with me. I'm currently typing this on a $2500 5 year old laptop and feel like if I shouldn't have both at the same time. My dad thinks that as long as I use the computer in moderation he'll agree buying the expensive one. I really feel like I don't deserve this computer. I don't do anything almost daily. I don't even really need the new computer, it was just a dumb idea that my dad said he was willing to pay for. What should I do hear? Do I just accept my dad gift and take the computer or should I hold off until the computer I'm currently using dies on me? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.","Am I spoiled?

teenagers,Movie recommendations for you guys who feel lonely. These movies will make you feel so hard,"These are all movies I watched and felt it in my heart cause I related to a lonely character. Romantically lonely, but also just plain lonely 

1.	JOKER ofc


2.	Thomas Crown Affair (1999) - more light hearted. Lonely billionaire has everything in life. But no people he truly trusts. No love, and no fun. He takes to stealing a priceless painting, and a detective tries to figure out why. I just related to the dude pretty hard, everyone’s like you got everything you get women all the time but he’s just like “no I don’t.” Good soundtrack


3.	Taxi Driver(1976 I think) - Guy who suffers insomnia takes a job as a taxi driver. Tries to make a life, but grows tired, frustrated, and crazy by the NYers. Soothing Jazz soundtrack, it feels like a Noir film, gritty. It’s a classic. Warning, violent.

4.	Fight Club - this is the Virgin Chad meme as a movie. Except it’s the virgin narrator and Tyler Dryden the Chad. They’re so fed up with they’re corporate drawl life they just go fuck it, and started and fighting club with their coworkers and shit. Any guy who feels life is utterly monotonous can relate


5.	Spider-Man 2 (Sam Raimi) - you gotta watch it as an adult. Yeah, it’s a little corny. But It’s got massive substance I missed as a kid. Peter Parker is so down on his luck this movie, and all he wants is to be a good guy and Spider-Man, but life keeps shitting on him. It’s more Peter Parker time than any other Spider-Man movie and I love it. Great characters, Harry Osborn is cooler than I remember, the side characters are fantastic, extras are hysterical “He stole that guys pizzas!” Just a fantastic movie that anyone who’s gone through a serious rough time in life will relate to. Peter Parker goes through a lot

There are very specific colors I like.

teenagers,I'm feeling really guilty.,"I need to tell SOMEBODY about this. I might have feelings for my friend who I know has a boyfriend. I also consider her boyfriend a friend. 

I only met her at the beginning of the school year at lunch. The school we go to is a sort of... Program focused school. It's made up of Juniors and Seniors from, like, 5 different counties surrounding the school. I had a friend from my home school move to a different school, but ended coming to this school with her friends she made at her new school. 

My new crush was her new best friend. I didn't really pay attention to her at first. I originally started becoming more friendly with her boyfriend. They sit next to each other and they both sit across from me. I'm straight, but me and her boyfriend like to act gay towards each other. We're a couple o' silly boys.

After I got Snapchat for the first time, (I mostly got it because my main school program chose that for their group chat app) I added them to Snapchat. I randomly messaged her. I forget what I sent, but it was probably a meme or something relating to whatever happened at lunch. Since then, we've been talking every now and then. Mostly just jokingly insulting each other. You know, like friends do. 

But one night, after a rough verbal beratement from my mom, I needed to vent to somebody. I messaged her about it, and she really calmed me down. Since then, we've been able to talk about more personal stuff in our life. Because of that, I started appreciating her more and more on, I started liking her. 

She just... Makes me feel better when I feel down. She feels down sometimes too. I also try to make her feel better. I don't know... I just feel really guilty about it. I needed to vent... Anyways. Good night. And if it's a different time for you! Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening!","I'm feeling really guilty. I need to tell SOMEBODY about this.

teenagers,My 3am thoughts,"Here are some things I literally woke up and wrote at 3am the other night. I was just sleeping then woke up was thinking about some things and tried to write them down, then went back to sleep.

What is happiness? Is it a feeling of contentment in the moment? Being in a long state of joy? Or is it simply not real?

Why oh why does it seem as everything is perfect but so bad? How can life be simultaneously incredible but melancholic?

How is it possible that ideas form in the mind only to be swirled around in the head, and when spoken or written down they fall out like too many objects packed into a closet that has just been opened - creating an impossible mess?

When will my thoughts actually become something other than the bland and pitiful grey, pale soup it is now? Or will it stay that way forever? Are the colours grey and white so bland after all? They world is so intricate and special with interesting things being found in the most 'boring' or 'bland' places, even these colours could have more meaning than what meets the eye.

It is only me. I am the problem. While the world is filled with so much, the only thing not wonderful - empty - is me. And I don't think there is anything that can fix that.","My 3am thoughts Here are some things I literally woke up and wrote at 3am the other night.

(Shirts being 5-10 dollars, and hoodies being 20 at most.) Also, the designs, are usually not that great. They're not really something you'd be proud to wear in public. Also, it's always like ""It's only going to be sold for 5 days! Better get it now before it's gone forever!"" Than, a month later, it's brought back permanently.","Why is youtuber merch so goddamn expensive? Like shirts are like $30!

teenagers,Is it weird for someone our age to like marbles and dominos?,"I've always been into marbles and dominos, but never had them as a kid. Now, I have the chance to get some but I feel sorta self-conscious about it all. I’m known for displaying a relatively sophisticated and mature sense of self. So, I’m just afraid that people might stop taking me seriously because I like things that are considered childish. What’s your take on the matter? Would a teenager having such possessions strike you as strange?

*Note: I’d rather you tell me you’d consider it off than lie. Lying isn’t answering my question, in fact, it’s a waste of my time. Just don’t worry about sparing anyone’s feelings.","Is it weird for someone our age to like marbles and dominos? I've always been into marbles and dominos, but never had them as a kid.

And I’ve been without physical contact from anyone for too long. I’m starting to become very lonely and sad.

teenagers,So my mom's old teacher got arrested-,"Happy Late Thankgiving, yall-

So yesterday night, we were eating our Thanksgiving dinner, like every year, and my mom was scrolling through her Facebook, and (I think) she started to either laugh a bit or she said ""oh my god"", I didn't think much of it because usually whenever she laughs or says that, it's just some meme in another language she understands, or a funny video (ex. a house for a car \[no, not a RV, a literal house as a car\]) but it wasn't that, it was her old 5th-6th grade teacher that got arrested because of showing pornography to a student. *(he was in his mid-late 30's but looked around 24 from the picture they showed)* 

*S*howing porn to a student when you are an Adult is actually illegal since it's Child Sexual Abuse Imagery (according to Google) . What I also learned from my parents, school, and my old therapist is porn isn't accurate when it comes to sex since it's not really educational and it's mainly a Male's POV in the videos. &gt;!I knew this since a couples months or a year or a half a year ago, I watched porn and got caught watching it, don't ask.!&lt;

**(imma be off topic for a bit, but bear with me)**  It would be fine if it was a sex education video since, well, it's educational for students, it shows what happens when they get older, and it's more accurate, but if it's porn and if you are using it as a way to show it to a student, well \*BONK\* Horny jail for you. 

Anyway, back on topic. So yeah, my mom's old teacher got arrested, and I think he had a wife, at least that's what my mom said though. after my mom reading the article about him and how it happened My mom said,  *""welp, now his whole teaching career is fucked up entirely. He ain't getting another teaching job now after that.""* 

Now that is what I call ""Embarrassing"".","So my mom's old teacher got arrested- Happy Late Thankgiving, yall-

teenagers,I just found out the worst news of my life,"I’ll start off by saying I’m a 13 year old female.

So I had this friend for years, almost going on 4 years. They’ve been one of my bestest friends ever. They were so kind, caring, they really were great. Today I got a text earlier from them saying that they are gonna kill themselves, I’ve always been the one to help them, they made me want to become a psychologist so I tried my usual, then I tried even harder, and harder, by then I’ve tried everything to convince them that there is a way out, but they didn’t listen. Now they blocked me, and I’m assuming they died by now of overdose. Just saying that doesn’t feel real, none of this feels real, I feel like I’m in a horrible dream but no matter what I can’t wake up, I just can’t!! 

They inspired me to do so much, they meant so much to me, truly they did.
But now they’re dead, they died hating my guts, they died thinking there wasn’t a way out, they died thinking no one would care, but I care and I care so much I’ve just decided to quit doing the things they inspired me to do.
I’m just gonna quit art for god knows how long, I’m never gonna become a psychologist (I’ve helped so many people and this was the first person who just ended it, ended it all) 

I don’t even know what I’m gonna do with my life, I thought last weekend life was gonna go uphill from here, but it just plummeted. 

I just want to die honestly, I can’t stand death and I don’t know what I’m gonna do from here. I won’t kill myself because I don’t want to put my girlfriend through the things my friend has put me through, honestly she’s probably worried sick because I haven’t messaged her since before I just balled my eyes out, I cried, and cried, and I’m crying while writing this. 

If you’re wondering, I can’t do anything to help, we were only online friends so I never found out their address, I tried to search for their school but no luck. I just hope they are okay and not dead but they probably are dead.

I just needed a place to type my feelings out in.

This is also a wake up call to anyone, please don’t kill yourselves, people will care and it will damage their lives for ever. You mean a lot to someone, please don’t forget that","I just found out the worst news of my life I’ll start off by saying I’m a 13 year old female.

Not some AR bullshit, not some Acog scope COD type Advanced Warshit. A handgun, locked in a safe, just in case. Probably a revolver, cause they’re simple to operate in a stressful situation. These days, with those George Floyd riots, and all the crazy shit, it’d be good to have something to protect myself just in case shit hit the fan. And I’m cheap, but it’s only like $450 for a good one anyway

I’d wait til I move out, and probably not tell my family","I want to buy a gun A year ago if you asked me about that, I’d think it’s crazy.

teenagers,I wrote a poem for a victim of the Columbine high school massacre.,"Lauren Townsend was 18 when she died in the Columbine High Library on April 20th, 1999. She spent her last minutes alive making sure her friends were calm. She had written in her diary months earlier that when she got to Heaven the first thing she wanted to do was meet Jesus. She has transformed my life for the better and I spent like an hour writing this poem in her honor. Criticism is always welcome!

**“Why you, why'd you die, on that April day in ‘99”**

**“Your life, full of smiles and fun, came to an end by the barrel of a gun”**

**“In the library, full of fear, you left us, but the Lord came near”**

**“Those two boys, spreading hate, ignored the pain they would create”**

**“The day was sunny, bright, and nice, ruined by those boys with hearts of ice”**

**“You went to school, as you always do, unaware that school would be your tomb”**

**“The last thing your mother saw you do, was you telling her that “I love you”**

**“Families mourned, Families cried, when you along with 12 others died”**

**“Early girl, you were born, on a cold January winter’s morn”**

**“Your childhood, full of life, could not be broken by any strife”**

**“You loved animals, Disney, and sports, you were a true leader on the volleyball court”**

**“Loved by all, no room for hate, you will always be number 8”**

**“You were innocent, you were kind, you had a beautiful and creative mind”**

**“It's been 20 years since you died, but those two boys can't take your rebel pride”**

**“Thinking about your death, gets me seething, but you always remind me, the trick is to keep breathing”**

**“You were a leader, you were a saint, but lets talk about the things you ain't”**

**“You weren't a bully, you weren't mean, you made sure everyone was part of the team”**

**“When you died, people cried, no one wanted to say goodbye”**

**“Your spirit lives on, in all of us, the spirit of warmth, optimism, and trust”**

**“America grieved, but only for a little while, because, for you, our tears turned into a smile”**

**“We smile for you Lauren, that's our way, of honoring you and the others that died that day”**

**“Lauren Townsend, everyone’s friend, she shouldn't have met her end, the way she did, full of fear and fright, but she still believed, “Everything’s gonna be alright”**

**“She told her friends that same line, and for them, everything was fine”**

**“Thanks to her, I have found, that the glory of the Lord abounds”**

**“Lauren Townsend, you're a flower divine, you are, I am, We are, Columbine”**

**“You're Heaven’s flower Lulu, like a Dove, I know you are with our God above, I know this because in the end, all their is, is love”**

 “**I do think humanity is losing touch with itself and their relationship with their surroundings. Unfortunately it usually takes a huge trauma to get people to realize what is important and I feel that is what is going to happen to wake up everyone to get in touch with their spiritual sides. I am not afraid of death for it is only a transition. For, in the end all there is, is love**.” - **Lauren Dawn Townsend**","I wrote a poem for a victim of the Columbine high school massacre.

teenagers,You know it's not interesting,"I must say something before:quarintine hasn't ended in Mexico, and this is a vent of how I feel

So a friend stopped talking us because we usually (me and a friend) sart the conversation

1.-I'm not good doing that

He says that we play games, he suggested fortnite and my other friend minecraft (i think you know  what I chose, I like shooting arrows to alive skeletons xd) but the problem was that he has bedrock and me and my other friend java

2.- Sorry, I cannot have bedrock

And then he blamed us because we ""suggest games that are exclusive from some parts""(he has java but doesn't like it)

thanks, this worked","You know it's not interesting I must say something before:quarintine hasn't ended in Mexico, and this is a vent of how I feel

I've always had small crushes on a few guys and my parents never knew compared to my brothers who tell them every single girl they ever liked. My whole family thought i was lesbian because they never seen me or heard me saying ""I like this guy in my class"" and other stuff because i just wanted to die single.

But now I finally found someone who made me feel safe and comfortable even tho we're LDR. He traveled thousands of miles just to see me for 4 days before going back to his home, And for the first time i was deep in love and i was so happy. i told my parents about our little so-called relationship that lasted a year. 

And Instead of them being happy about it, they now think that i flirt and fall for every guy i meet, my mom specifically mentioned that i might even get pregnant at an early age because she thinks i would just give my virginity to every guy i would find attractive. It might not be much for u guys but for me, It hurts. Alot.","My parents already think of me as a slut just because I've fallen for someone for the first time Yep, u read that right.

teenagers,Why do parents favor the younger children more than the oldest?,My parents straight up spoil my younger siblings(4 of them). Then I’m just a disappointment and a mistake. When I was younger my parents never bought me anything. I had to illegally work at a restaurant(illegal cause of my age) just to buy the phone I’m using now like a few months ago. I never had any consoles or anything. Whenever I became interested in something they just shut me down. Like when I first got interested in music they sold my saxophone. Which I got pre-job by shoveling snow(we live in Chicago so it snows a lot). And then when I got interested in cooking they said that it’s gay for a guy to cook and shut me down. And now when I’m interested in computer science they said computers and video games are just a fad and I will gain nothing. My siblings on the other hand get everything. They got a Nintendo switch and an Xbox 1s from my dad. And today they got a new tv which my dad payed for. Then now with my money I just wanna buy a new ssd for the pc I built from my money which I worked for. Whenever I buy something I use my parents’ credit card and give them the cash so they lose nothing. So when I asked for the card my dad started yelling. He said my money should go to him and not for myself. He said I should support the family. But he doesn’t need help. He makes 6 figures from his job as a doctor. He doesn’t need his child who makes minimum wage to help him. So I called him out for buying a tv for my brother as a gift but he won’t let me spend the money in my pocket. He told me that’s irrelevant cause they are younger. Even though when I was their age he did none of this shit for me and treated my ass like a disappointment. So I snapped cause I’ve had too much of this shit. Am I the asshole for snapping and arguing with my dad?,Why do parents favor the younger children more than the oldest?

He woke up in a a hell scape. Not knowing where he was, who he was, or what was happening. All he could see was fire and destruction. He was nothing special and did nothing that could make them noticeable but here he was, the only thing alive in what the world could consider as hell on earth. He walked arround looking for a sign of life or some hint as to what had happened. As he enters an apartment looking for someone's diary he sees a shattered plate and cookies, they look a few days old and they where on the floor but he didn't mind, he was hungry. He woke up on the floor of the room, laying in the crumbs of the cookies. It was like he blacked out. He considered the thought he was drugged by the cookies but he shrugged it off and left. He was walking in the bare street looking for something, anything, but there was nothing but rubble. He looked down a ally way and he saw a shadow o ffs something moving... it was round and had arms and legs. He assumed it was a fat man but how could someone be so obese in this kind of world? Perhaps it hadn't last that long? He knew if he wanted answers he would have to chase this shadow. *pant pant pant* He was hungry again, as if he was the embodiment of the gluttony sin he didn't feel full from those cookies from earlier. He had grown tired of chasing the shadow and felt like he wasn't gaining on the mysterious figure. The shadow trips and falls, He knows this is his chance to catch up with the shadow who is having a hard time getting back on their feet. He turns the corner and what lies infront of him is something that was more Bizarre than jojo. It was a cookie. But not a normal cookie, nonono, this was *Special*. This cookie had arms, legs, and a face that read petrifying fear with no words. He felt tired and full of fear as if he knew something bad was about to happen and he fainted. He woke up at sometime in the night. The only light was from the fires, the cookie man was gone but there was crumbs right where he layed. He realized he wasn't feeling hungry anymore and peiced together what had just taken place. He covered his eyes and cryed. He finally remembered what had happened to the world. He remembered who he was. He wasn't some nobody, he was the cookie monster. He wasn't being punished, he WAS the punishment.","Question, Why can I onky post text post? Seriously why?

teenagers,How can I talk to my mom about properly treating my mental illness(es) without her getting upset?,"I (18F) have struggled with mental illness for most of my life. I won't go into detail about what I'm dealing with but it arose due to a lot of trauma I've endured, along with some of it being in my bloodline. It's destroying my life.

In the past I've tried talking to my mom about it. Many, many times. She blows it off as me being lazy and feeling sorry for myself and that I just need to ""make the choice to be happy."" You'd think if it were that easy then I'd be fine. Clearly I'm not. But I digress. I want to finally make a step towards getting better, but in order to do that I need a proper diagnosis and treatment (before anyone tells me otherwise, you should know that I've seen 5 therapists now and they've all either been of no help or have made me feel worse). I don't know how to talk to my mom about it without upsetting her again. 

I understand that since I'm 18 I could schedule these appointments myself. The only reason I worry about that is I'm still on my mom's health insurance, which would probably be used to cover the costs of most everything. I could try to hide it but she would probably find out sooner than later. 

If this is the wrong subreddit to be asking this in, then my apologies. I'd just like as much advice as I can get so that I can work towards becoming better :)","How can I talk to my mom about properly treating my mental illness(es) without her getting upset?

Seriously, he's the WORST business man ever! So he's got a thneed monopoly, great, those'll sell. But he than continues to completely destroy the only goddamn source of thneed material without giving re-planting a second thought. I mean, I get it, you're a business man, doing business, but you should notice that  your only goddamn source of income. If you have one forest and each tree can make one thneed, you have a limited thneed supply if you don't replant. If he outright refuses to replant due to being an asshole (which he is, this fits) at the very least go into other forms of business man! You don't build an empire on a limited monopoly and not even attempt to start a new business. For fuck sake, you're living off snail shells in a rickety old shack by the end of this!

TL;DR: the once-ler both a pure evil metaphor of corporate greed, as well as a moron who doesn't realize that his empire is built on a single product that he runs the fuck out of in the end.","So I was thinking about the Lorax...

teenagers,A family friend just got murdered,"So it’s thanksgiving. We were supposed to go to my sisters(we’ll call her Ann) house. Turns out her boyfriend’s dad took his own live that morning.

Ann just came to our house in tears. 
 
Now for backstory, her boyfriend’s mom (we’ll call her POS) has always been, well, a POS. We’ve know her for years and she’s always been mean. She’s stolen money from my Ann, didn’t feed her boyfriend because “he was an adult”. She was just mean.

Turns out, it wasn’t a suicide. POS killed him and staged it as a suicide. She hid all the firearms and dangerous things. 

Now Ann doesn’t know what to do. Her boyfriend might get taken into foster care, we don’t know.

The days keep getting worse.","A family friend just got murdered So it’s thanksgiving. We were supposed to go to my sisters(we’ll call her Ann) house. Turns out her boyfriend’s dad took his own live that morning.

teenagers,The problem with most shows based around teenagers,"So we’re all teenagers and we all know that teenagers are not represented very accurately in TV. I’m blame this on 2 factors: 

# 1. The cast is too old

We all know the memes. TV (and movies), portray teenagers as much older looking then they actually are. Most TV “teenagers” are in their 20s, which is a problem. Why is this? I’m guessing it’s because the pool of actually talented teenage actors is limited. We’ve all seen bad child actors, and teenagers aren’t too much older. But shows with teens that have actual teenagers play teenagers can work. Look at stranger things, actual teenagers play teenagers in that show and it’s great. My suggestion to any TV execs (if any are reading this), is look to the internet. You can find talented teen actors on a variety of different social media’s like Tiktok and YouTube. Teens are creating skits which they act on everyday, most aren’t good actors, but some actually have some talent. 

#2. Old people write the shows 

Most tv shows about teenagers aren’t even written by young people. This creates a disconnect between the writers and the audience. Lots of shows have this problem, shows like big mouth and 13 reasons why. Again youtube and Tiktok have an advantage here. Most people making content on these platforms make content for people in their age group. There are plenty of great writers under 30 if you know where to look for them. Sketch comedy by young people is so common now a days and a lot of it is really good. We need shows about teenagers written by actual teenagers and younger people in general. Teens are written to be so mature, in some teen shows, and it’s annoying, they sound like they’re in their 40s not in their teens. One show I like that is aimed for a younger audience is the show Atlanta, that show actually has young people in its writers room. There’s a video on YouTube where Donald Glover talks about how he actually hired an 18 year old to help write for the first season of that show, and it shows. The show deals a lot with internet culture and it feels so natural and real, which I assume is because it has someone from the younger generation to make sure everything is accurate. 

So here’s my pitch, Netflix, Hulu, HBO. Pick up my show, which will have an age accurate cast, the youngest writers room in history which comprises of YouTubers, Tiktokers, creative writings experts from r/teenagers (/s), etc. Have actual teenagers write dialogue for teenagers godammit! Because who knows teenagers more than teenagers?! Bring in boomer directors I don’t care, but cast teens, and let the teens write the shows! Just because we’re young doesn’t necessarily mean we can’t write stories that appeal to our peers.","The problem with most shows based around teenagers So we’re all teenagers and we all know that teenagers are not represented very accurately in TV.

teenagers,Philosophy stuff I guess?,"I'm not the philosophic type but a game (Night in The Woods) made me think about life and other stuff. *Ahem* here it goes.

If we remove the part of us that we can touch and see,what is left? Are we what some people say we are?; Just a bunch of meat being controlled by a brain?
I mean. We can feel things that aren't touchable. Like when we play a game or watch a movie and we empathize with a character that we know doesn't exist. Despite it does not *actually* feel something nor exists in space,it can become real and feel in our minds; Which is also something we can't touch but only ""feel"".

So I got this question. When we die,does our mind die? I mean,we can cut and kill our body because we can touch it. But can we kill what we can only feel? Is it possible to kill a feeling? Can our minds just stop existing? If yes,what happens the "" me"" I know? The ""me"" that have learned and felt so many things? The ""me"" that exists since I started breathing and changed so much throughout the time? This whole thing inside my head that is my whole life! An entire life (or at least 16 years of life) of experiences,knowledge and feelings? Where all this stuff go when I die? What happens to it?

Just another thing related to this matter ,and that the game taught me.
We WILL eventually die. And after a while we WILL be forgotten (Most of us. There's people like Faraday,Newton,Darwin who had extreme importance on what we know that will probably be remembered as long as we exist) but there's things that will last longer than any human. Our creations for example. And even if people from the future won't remember it for what it is meant to be remembered. They will still be the only thing left to be remembered . Take cave paintings for example. Do we know why did they painted them? Do we know what did they want people to understand from those paintings? Not for sure! We can only theorise. But we see the paintings and we feel something,we know something from those paintings even if it's not what it was intended to. And that's all we will leave behind when we die and all we got from people that were gone long before we had been born.

I will finish this unusual post with a sentence from the game and one of my own.

teenagers,I keep finding myself angry at my new puppy.,"Alright I know. This title doesn’t sound good. But 7 months ago, I got the best puppy I’ve ever had, his name was Buster. He got along so well with my family and we loved him to death. 2020 had been complete shit for me and my family especially for my sister, as she’s homeschooled because of a gymnastics program, and one of her only friends was moving. So after about 2 months of having buster, me and my mother decided to take my sister to a surprise trip to a beach an hour away for the weekend. I was given the decision to watch the puppy or go to the beach. If I chose to go to the beach, the puppy would be brought to my aunts and would be puppysat for the weekend. I loved Buster so much but I haven’t been to the beach for years and I trusted my aunt. So once we got to the beach, it took us an extra 6 hours to get into our hotel room, but once we were in we had some fun. At around 4:00 pm, my father called my mother frantically that Buster had ran away at my aunts house. The next two days were the worst of my life. I loved Buster so much and I blamed myself for him running away for another 4 months. Three days after he initially ran away and no sleep for my family as we were out searching 24/7, we had finally found Buster. He was ran over and had died instantly. After a month after his passing, my parents had gotten a new puppy, moose. I still hadn’t gotten over Buster’s passing then. Moose was causing so much trouble for both me and my family. He would go to the bathroom in the house every 5 minutes regardless of how much water we gave him and how much we took him outside. He was getting indescribably attached to my family and would scream his head off even if we were to go upstairs for a minute or two. We had to take him everywhere and my parents especially had no free time as all eyes had to be on Moose. I would get so angry at Moose for not being like Buster. I still love Moose but I still haven’t gotten over Buster. Moose is still getting better but I just still can’t get over losing Buster. I know this is incredibly stupid but I just don’t know what to do at this point.","I keep finding myself angry at my new puppy. Alright I know. This title doesn’t sound good.

i'd also love it if you could stop the ""no man would marry a girl like you!"" for every mistake I make. and the guilt-tripping, telling me I'm the biggest disappointment and other girls love cleaning and kids. 

remember that show we watched and the unmarried women lost? and you saw the need to go ""well, she's not married. how did she expect to win?"" when the competition had nothing to do with marriage? maybe don't do that again.

and then the suffocating speeches at dinner about how women with kids are ""scientifically happier"" than women without them? as if you don't spend the whole day complaining about how kids ruined your life?

lol, I'm just kidding, mom. no need to take my phone away. unmarried women are failures. everyone knows that.","dear mom, stop acting like I'm messed up just because I don't want a child.

teenagers,"What if you could feel natural euphoria on demand? Would you wanna know how? And honestly I don't understand why no one talks about this, I Think that the evil agents of this world are trying to suppress this knowledge from the public.","

I used to feel all types of negative emotions, rarely experiencing the positive ones. Before finding this.

You might've heard of it before (chi, life-force, prana, qi, ki, pitī, rapture, chills, Spiritual Chillls, goosebumps, ecstasy, euphoria, aura, mana, ruah, nephesch and many more).

Not only is this energy the very essence of the positive emotions in our physical body it's in every thing in nature.

After understanding this energy that is most easier felt with goosebumps, I can will this this pure euphoric energy everywhere in my body. I finally found Balance and the ability to deflect any negativity that may come from the outside world.

If you are interested in taking control of your energy and feel euphoria on-demand I made this short [tutorial YouTube video](https://youtu.be/i8wpXSbQV5s)  explaining how you can also Activate your Spirits power.","What if you could feel natural euphoria on demand? Would you wanna know how? And honestly I don't understand why no one talks about this, I Think that the evil agents of this world are trying to suppress this knowledge from the public. 

I used to feel all types of negative emotions, rarely experiencing the positive ones. Before finding this.

teenagers,Hi everyone,"Im an Albanian from Kosovo and im shaking and crying soo hard and im only 12 im going to tell you why.
So in in the 90s Serbia held captive Kosovo and said it was apart of their country so Kosovo my home country declared war on Serbia we won but it came with a cost and that cost was war crime: massacres, genocides, rapes, burning of houses etc. I was looking at tik tok with drips of tears little by little seeing things that Serbia has done to our country then in one video from the account albanian.roots made me burst into tears at 3 am it was a video of houses being burnt down kids crying a woman saying that they tried to kill her son a man holding his wallet with the pictures of his two little kids i wanna spread awareness beacuse Kosovo didnt have a army when they declared war well we did but with such a low amount that even students were volunteering to get in the army just to save our country and now Serbia is trying to blame us for the people that they killed theyre trying to blame us the people that raped killed civilians are trying to blame us and now there was the most recent video of that account and it was a veteran of the army and he said that in the massacre of Izbica he said we were so little soldiers to bury 147 massacred people many with no head many with no bottom half of their body many kids many burned alive and then he said that “I opened 6 to 7 grave a night and I dont think i can do that now since i was one of the youngest soldiers there “
So now our veterans our ministers those who’ve taken part in the war Albanians are taken to special court not the Serbians. In football there was a match Switzerland vs Serbia we had two ethnic Albanians from Kosovo in that match Xherdan Shaqiri and Granit Xhaka both when they scored made the symbol of the eagle which is a Albanian symbol that has been used for many years had been fined with 10,000$ for making that symbol and Albanians raised 27,000$ to pay. So spread the message and good bye.","Hi everyone Im an Albanian from Kosovo and im shaking and crying soo hard and im only 12 im going to tell you why.

teenagers,My girlfriend just broke up with me because she realized she was gay,"Well fuck me I guess the title pretty much says it all, I've been dating this girl and it was going great until literally a few hours ago where she decided that she wanted to break up because she realized she was gay. I kinda feel like shit right now we had gotten really close and I genuinely don't know how to feel. I told her that it was ok and that it wasn't her fault so she shouldn't feel bad but I can't help but miss her and feel shitty about myself, feeling as though as if I wasn't enough even though she assured me that I was. I feel as if I'm putting on a facade so that she won't feel bad about it and I'm just holding in all of these conflicting emotions. I just told a few if my friends and I'm waiting to get shit on by them now. Worse post is I'm now into a bunch of weird and kinky shit that's probably never going to happen again.","My girlfriend just broke up with me because she realized she was gay Well fuck me I guess the title pretty much says it all, I've been dating this girl and it was going great until literally a few hours ago where she decided that she wanted to break up because she realized she was gay.

Last week she said that she liked me, the next day she said we're just friends, then a week later she says that she wants to be more than friends!

My friends don't know what I should do. She has a boyfriend that she hates but won't break up with. Should I ask if she was joking? Should I agree with the more than friends statement? Should I be angry at her for trying to mess with the friendship? Today, before she said that she wants to be more than friends, she was with a friend and looked like she was laughing at what she was about to do. A new possibility arosed that she might be fucking with me.","My friend keeps giving me mixed signals So a week ago I made a post about how my friend was giving me mixed signals and how she said she liked me then saying we were just friends.

teenagers,Ugly Duckling Story,"I just wanted to write this for the sake of just writing it and getting it off my chest 

So, I (17M) am very inexperienced. I’ve never had a girlfriend and haven’t even kissed a girl. I was an ugly duckling and thus, never really got attention from girls. Combine this with the fact that I’m a shy, nervous , and awkward person and you get someone who is very inexperienced. 

However, during the summer before junior year, I grew out my hair a little more and parted it in the middle. I thought that I looked better than I did before and I certainly did. During that summer, my family and I went to Vietnam to visit the rest of our family(my aunts, uncles, and cousins) I remember my aunt saying how I was handsome (i know I know, doesn’t mean much but it felt good) I started getting a bit more confident

During Junior year, I felt something different, One day, when I was walking into school, a girl who I didn’t know said “Hi” to me as I walked past, I found it odd since she didn’t know me and I wasn’t popular so I wasn’t sure why she said it ,but I didn’t think much of it.

Throughout Junior year, I got quite a few compliments about my hair, this really got me more confident and soon I started to believe that I was an attractive person 

It felt like girls were looking at me more, whether it was in class or when I was walking into school.One time, I caught a girl staring at me in class, which felt good

One time during lunch (Ok so, my school has tables and benches in the quad area, so most students eat lunch sitting outside) I decided to go to the library after finishing my lunch. I got up and took the path I always did to the library. There were a couple of girls sitting about 10 feet away from where I was walking. As I walked past them, I heard one of them say “He’s fucking hot” . I  saw out of the corner of my eye, one girl facing me when I walked past. I was also the only person on this section of sidewalk at this time. I began smiling immediately. Now obviously, she could’ve been talking about someone else but I don’t think she was. I strongly believe that this girl called me hot when I was walking past and she didn’t think I was able to hear her 

This obviously made my fucking day,
Another time, when I was walking to lunch, I was walking past a girl who was standing still and as I walked past, I thought she took a glance at my crotch, this one is a bit more iffy and I wasn’t certain, but I’m pretty sure she took a glance 

Maybe all of these situations with girls were wrong and I’m just being moronic teen but all of these little things gave me confidence and now, I believe that I am an attractive individual.

I’m less shy than I was, but  I’m still very nervous  and awkward, I want to start dating soon but the thought of having a girlfriend is just so nerve wrecking, like driving a car for the first time. It’s like everyone around me has a significant other and they know what they’re doing and I’m so nervous that my heart beats 400 times a minute when I compliment my crush (true story). The thought of having a girlfriend utterly terrifies me yet it entices me at the same time

teenagers,I hate when people ghost you.,"So I met this girl at a party (it was a small party please don’t make COVID a huge deal), and we hit it off and she gave me her Snapchat. We had snapchated for like a week not really saying anything until I feel like she kind of made a move so I shot my shot and kind of flirted with her. We depended the next week going back in fourth asking each other questions and stuff. She seemed pretty interested.

She kept kind of hinting that she wasn’t gonna be able to hang out until finally she just stopped talking to me.

My teacher asked her to come to my school and when I did she started making irrational arguments that lead to her yelling at me. This happened a second time. The time was because I got fed up with my mom and couldnt handle it anymore and hit my head on the wall.

Guess what. My teacher got involved. She confiscated my phone and made me remove my locks and idk what  she checked on my phone. Dont worry I got it back after anotger teacher which is older and has more experience gave me my phone after my dad and there and she made me feel better. I just stay in my room now and avoid talking to my parents."

teenagers,"Experience: 7 days without using the internet, i someone cares :D","I made it. Spent 1 week using my phone only for school work / study and very occasional texting. 

The first day was really strange, especially because it was a saturday. I got to finally clean my bedroom properly and I studied. I felt really lighter than usual. It was strange to do breaks from studying, not being abke to just go straight to my phone, so I just stared at my ceiling. I felt pretty good, but empty at the same time.

The rest of the time, I think I did pretty well. I started to read, and I read a lot more than usual. I started reading like 1-3 hours a day, more or less. When I didnt wanted to study and my bedroom was already clean, and before sleeping, I just went to books. Great improvement, since I enjoy reading but couldnt do it because of my phone. 

A big difference was not constantly listening to music or podcasts. I did it almost every hour of the day. At the first few days, it was really strange. Eating, doing my breakfast, doing the dishes and walking to school not listening to anything. It may seem excessive, but it was really positive. Quiet time really helps, and after a few days, it started to became normal to just spend time only thinking to myself.

I started to write too, wich is helping me dealing with my emotions and problems. Unfortunately, giving up on my phone didnt make me study much more. I'm still working on that.

I really missed youtube or some kind of entertainment. But now I have been back to the internet for almost 2 hours. And I realised I didn't miss anything. Its kinda boring. I was really excited to come back, but reality is often disapointing.

Finally, I think this was very important to me, I was spending like 10 hours on the phone, and not counting with the hours I got my headphones on. From now on? I think I will schedule my phone time. And you should do the same. Everytime my niece came to my home, I used to carry my phone at all times. Today she was here, and I never checked it. Didn't use reddit. Just played.

I almost gave up when I was feeling super sad. I didn't had anything except reading to forget about the problems.
Reddit really helped me distract during hard times, but sometimes you need to be with your own thoughts, even if its hard as hell.

teenagers,Any other guys feel this way?,"   To clarify, I am a 100% straight male and come with all the trappings that that entails. I like girls. I like girls’ bodies, too, in a healthy straight adolescent male way.

   However, I can’t really bring myself to think of girls I have known / even are acquaintances of sexually. Because of this, when I really get to know a girl well, and I initially would want to be in a relationship with her, I kinda come to a halt mentally because I highly respect those I admire. I already have high standards for a partner- that’s a choice that I’m not going to change. So, regardless, deep down I don’t want a girlfriend right now anyways- without beating around the bush, I’m more mature than most people I know that are my age, and I somewhat feel something intrinsically wrong about thinking of people I know- people I respect and love (the surface level kind of love)- people who have opened up to me about things- sexually. 

   Perhaps it’s the fact that I don’t like to surround myself with immature “popular” girls. Hell, I don’t find a lot of them attractive at all, because real attractiveness comes from self confidence, which many popular people have none of.

   I’ve gone on a longish rant, sorry! Wrapping back around, I simply wanted to know if there are other guys here who feel similarly. I feel like it’s good that I treat girls I know this way, but I also feel like it may hinder my love life down the road. Or perhaps, by college, I’ll have surrounded myself with more self confident girls and I can develop feelings for them without guilt and feeling like I’m using someone who isn’t as “mature” as me.","Any other guys feel this way?

teenagers,"Parents, fear/pessimistic behaviour isn't gonna bring your kids somewhere good in life.","I've seen a lot of the old ""Do this or else"" in a lot of places, mainly because fear is something parents use to bring us motivation. Except it DOES NOT. Fear just gives us anxiety and just  makes us more conscious of the bad outcomes. Being pessimistic also does this to teens. It's not healthy to keep your child scared for eternity


Take grades for example, if they see your good grades and say, ""wow, you did great!"" instead of being pessimistic and saying ""you got bad grades again"", which sounds better? of course the first one, because that motivates you to make them happier, instead of the second one, which just makes you think,""but i had good grades :(("". 


Parents should start adopting the ""love your good things"" style of motivation instead of ""hate your bad things"", which is why a bit of the people turn to this subreddit for advice and coping.

Another thing, blaming anything on the phone or any other electronic device is just WRONG. That's like blaming ants for the invasion of aliens. Them being depressed is at least a bit your fault for inputting pessimistic and fear-centered thoughts into their head.

teenagers,I accidentally made a viral YouTube video.,"So 6 days ago I posted a video on my SECOND channel of my dog howling but in autotune.

teenagers,Being an introvert is not the same as being shy or having bad social skills.,"An introvert can socialise, can do small talk, have a lot of friends, party, or idk ACT FRICKING NORMAL

Social skills are not really about being and introvert or an extrovert. Being and introvert means you spend energy by socialising and gain back the energy by yourself. And that's it. 

Yes, introverts have a tendency to avoid socialising or have less friends, but it's just to make our lives easier/more comfortable. Hating small talk is common because it sucks but it is not something you can't improve. 

Stop blaming poor social skills on being an introvert, it's just finding an excuse to not work on yourself. I am totally an introvert and I have pretty decent social skills, it's not impossible. Please.","Being an introvert is not the same as being shy or having bad social skills. An introvert can socialise, can do small talk, have a lot of friends, party, or idk ACT FRICKING NORMAL

teenagers,I need an excuse to as for a P.O. box for Christmas,"Background: 

I came out as Asexual to my mother a little over a month ago, to sum it up it didn't go well. I asked for a flag for my birthday and she said ""I don't want you to restrict yourself"" and ""You're too young to be thinking about labels, this generation is too obsessed with labels."" I realized I was also biromantic a few weeks later. (No I haven't told her, nor do I intend to.)  I decided to get myself a flag (and some other things) by ordering it online. My mother tracks both my credit and debit card purchases, but I can get around that buy purchasing a gift card with cash. 

However, once the package is delivered, my mother will open it and immediately lose her mind. But if I can buy a P.O. box, (an address where the mail is delivered to the post office and you pick it up there, for those who don't know) I can walk to the post office and pick up my stuff without her knowing. But, to buy a P.O. box you have to be 18 and they aren't cheap. 

My plan is to ask for a P.O. box for Christmas, but I don't have a good reason to ask for one. I don't want her to get suspicious, any ideas reddit?","I need an excuse to as for a P.O. box for Christmas Background:

teenagers,True loneliness,"Parents judge me, downplay and diminish my experiences/stories, and don’t believe most of em. Friends do the same, and my siblings as well. I’m 18 years old, and *literally* every time I’ve opened up, it’s backfired. I even called my mother a few nights ago, I asked her over the phone: “was I a good son?” And she said things like “of course you are! I love you” blah blah and whatever bs lies *all* parents (yes all parents because parents only concern themselves with the physical well being of a child) usually say.

She asked: “what is this all about? Are you sad or something?” Oh God, I hate it whenever people ask me how I’m doing, I *HATE IT*. My brain malfunctioned and I just went: “y-yeah but it’s alright though, it doesn’t matter because other people have it worse you know? So my sadness doesn’t matter, right?” Ya know how she responded? “That’s right sweetie, plenty of people out there have it horrible, so we can’t be depressed”. 

I’m actually all alone, I never thought this would happen to me. But now I’m not in school, I already graduated and I’m working. I can’t open up at work because co workers don’t care about people’s emotions, and that’s a logical assumption I can make. If my parents, friends, and family as a whole don’t care, constantly judge and berate me, then who’s capable of actually letting me open up without any of the aforementioned negatives? I can’t afford therapy, so that’s out the window. Besides, I highly doubt therapists even care about their patients, they’re just in it for the money. And they also judge their patients, just like everyone else does. It might not be severe judgment, but they still judge. They also downplay people’s experiences constantly. They’ll just tell me: “yeah yeah big deal, go to the doctor and get em to prescribe you some medicine”. 

I can’t do shit. 

Feels fucking great. I’m going to actually have to keep everything in, until the day I die. I’m going to die all alone. My story will not be remembered, and even if it is, those that remember it will just dismiss it, as they did when I was alive. What if I just end my life by my own hands? To end the pain quickly. Oh but that’s selfish, right? Everyone always says: “suicide is selfish, it doesn’t end the pain, it just spreads it”.

Let me tell all you idiots, who constantly spew this nonsense, something; why do you think it’s ok to cause the victim suffering and pain, yet not find it ok when they decide to end it when they have no other choice (other than constantly live with the pain, which really isn’t much of a better alternative, is it)? It’s so acceptable for the victim to live alone with their pain, carrying the burden, with not a single person caring about it. AH! But when they pull the plug on themselves, NOW everyone cares! NOW everyone’s in pain! NOW everyone makes an effort to comfort them, WHEN THEY’RE ALREADY DEAD! YOUR WORDS OF ‘EMPATHY’ DON’T MEAN SHIT WHEN THE VICTIM IS ALREADY DEAD! WHERE WERE THOSE WORDS OF COMFORT WHEN THE VICTIM WAS STILL ALIVE?! WHERE? WHERE WAS THE EFFORT?! 

I love life... it’s so bliss, but only when accompanied by ignorance or innocence, both of which I lost long, long ago. What’s even worse is that I’m a man, meaning it’s even worse if I open up. At least with most women, they can safely open up. Not a man though, not a man. No sir, a man has to be “tough”, “emotionless”. 

But hey people have it worse, so I don’t have the right to be depressed. That’s all anyone ever says. It’s such a broken record at this point, but it’s the only one that plays.","True loneliness Parents judge me, downplay and diminish my experiences/stories, and don’t believe most of em.

teenagers,Violent thoughts over somebody I have a crush on,"Basically I have a crush on somebody on discord, I’ve never seen their face but I’ve fallen in love with them....hard.

It feels like my life was cold and empty without them, they’re something to look up to, I would die for them, they’re my life.

Seeing other people say things like “I love you” to them gets me so angry, one of their friends says it to them and i know I shouldn’t be getting mad but I despise that person, I feel like they’re purposely trying to get in my way and I get violent thoughts about them.

I want to hurt them so badly, they’re in my way.","Violent thoughts over somebody I have a crush on Basically I have a crush on somebody on discord, I’ve never seen their face but I’ve fallen in love with them....hard.

teenagers,My dog passed away today,"She was 13 years old, my parents own a resort and about 11 years ago she wandered onto our property, she was skin and bones, covered in ticks and she was just rough, my mom didn’t want her but me and sister begged to keep her, my mom took her to the vet, we got her fed and all fixed up.

teenagers,My Mom,"Well where do I start. She is an anti masker and believes in almost every Facebook conspiracy she finds. So that should tell you a few things. She just showed me an article from a source that I have never heard of, that Bill Gates is developing a cure for Corona virus but wait according to the article its actually a micro tracker that will take away our freedom of thought even, and we're all gonna become slaves to the government. A few months ago I voiced my support for BLM. She then proceeds to get angry at me and says she is failing as a parent if I cant see the truth. I told her I didn't care what she thought as I am my own person. A few minutes and choice words later I leave angry, frustrated and in awe of the stupidity of one of the closest people in my life. She says if there does wind up being a covid cure soon we wont get it. And apparently the fact that other countries are doing better than the U.S makes little sense to her. After always listening to her as a child it's very strange to see how wrong she is about things in the world. The funniest thing is she believes all these right wing conspiracies but she isn't even a Trump supporter. Anyway thanks for coming to my TED talk everyone.","My Mom Well where do I start.

teenagers,Runaway and Homeless Youth Program [Repost],"LPT: Around 18 and having problems at home? Kicked out, running away, or abuse/neglect? The US funds a $300 million dollar Runaway and Homeless Youth Program with our taxes. Assistance could just be advice over the phone all the way to shelter, food, clothing, life skills, and housing help.

A state by state list is here: [https://www.acf.hhs.gov/fysb/grants/fysb-grantees](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/fysb/grants/fysb-grantees)Just click the state and then click Runaway and Homeless Youth in blue.

The real value of the places outside of the material support they provide is that they've been there! Wondering what happens if you runaway at 17 years old in a specific state when you're being neglected? They know! Did you just move to a new state and are considering reporting abuse by your parents but don't know what the foster care system looks like in you new state? They do! Can you open a bank account without a parent, etc. - they likely know! They also take calls from siblings, parents, extended family, kinship placements, child welfare workers, etc.

**There are 5 very important services funded by the RHY program.**

**Basic Center Program:** Shelter program which includes counseling, trauma-informed care, life skills, and other help. Usually for kids under 18, depends on the state.

**Maternity Group Home Program:** Shelter for youth with kids, must be between the ages of 16 and 22 to enter the program. Life skills, child development, parenting help, budgeting, nutrition, etc.

**Transitional Living Program:**  Must be between the ages of 16 and 22 to enter the program. Life skills, job help, nutrition, budgeting ,etc.

**Street Outreach Program:** My favorite program. Outreach workers meet youth where they are at on the streets, in parks, etc. These outreach workers adjust to whatever level of support you need- they could just drop off food and warm clothes or they could help you access emergency shelter and sign up for health insurance.

**National Runaway Safeline:**  1-800-RUNAWAY or [http://www.1800runaway.org/](http://www.1800runaway.org/). They were an actual switchboard back in the day that would allow kids to contact their families if they ran away. Now they have forums on their website where thousands of kids ask a ton of questions FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD about how to be safe. They work with Greyhound to provide bus trips home for runaway youth and also do a lot of outreach around issues concerning runaway and homeless youth.","Runaway and Homeless Youth Program [Repost] LPT: Around 18 and having problems at home?

teenagers,These PS5 scalpers need to be shut the fuck down....,"The PS5 console launched recently and scalpers are individuals or even whole groups who buy a large amount of consoles and sell them at a higher prize.

These fuckers buy thousands of consoles (500€ each) and charge ridiculous prizes like 1500€ for each console.

There's a high demand for these consoles but they are currently mostly sold out. They are extremely hard to get because of these scalpers.

I wanted to get a Playstation 5 next month to play Cyberpunk 2077 on during the winter break, but these dumb bitches are ruining my plans.

I hope these scalpers get shut down. All of them.","These PS5 scalpers need to be shut the fuck down.... The PS5 console launched recently and scalpers are individuals or even whole groups who buy a large amount of consoles and sell them at a higher prize.

then i’m attacked by a ton of action movie randos, in which i use a shotgun to defend myself and suddenly i am surrounded by the randos and for some reason mary saotome from kakegurui is being held captive. a ton of floor lasers go off and i wake up.

what the fuck? i can understand andy samberg, because i’ve been watching a little too much snl lately but why specifically that classmate and saotome? firstly we’re only friends AND saotome isn’t even my favourite from the series.","saw someone dream posting so i will do it too i just used my apartment block’s elevator to go to another planet with a bright city. for some reason, i killed someone there.

Anyways I know this person has Reddit and if you see this just don't mention it. 

Ps, this guy I like still wants to be friends for god knows what reason."

teenagers,"Let’s talk about comfort characters, shall we?","I know you’re probably asking yourself “why the fuck do I care??” Because I know you probably fucking don’t. But still, it’s better to read this to understand some people and so you won’t insult someone by accident or make them feel like garbage.


So “what is a comfort character”? You might be asking. Well, 

A comfort character is a fictional character someone has for comfort, they make them feel better, they want to spend time with this character, sometimes they want to date and marry this character sometimes they want to be kept as friends. 

It could be their oc, an anime character, a cartoon character, a version of that character from a parallel universe, anyone, without a doubt you’ll find that one person that has Remy from ratatouille as their comfort character. We don’t judge here. 

Unless it’s like, Hisoka or something but then we just ignore and don’t question it, we know he’s a pedo and he’s gross but at least he’s sorta respectful in some ways, just leave the person alone, no judgement if something then keep it to yourself.

Anyways, that being out of the way, here’s some things you should do/say when a person tells you about their comfort character whether it is by accident or not.

“You should get help for that,”.

Laugh at them.

Insult their character or them.

Make fun of them in any way unless they will let you and be aware that you’re joking.

There is more examples but basically, don’t insult or bully someone for having a comfort character, the character for them is here for a reason, they might be struggling and not be able to find help that easily might be stressful, I have a comfort character that I like to joke about him kidnapping me to his castle because I want to escape from humanity. It’s a coping mechanism and it’s pretty much harmless. 

People will bully every flaw you have, and if you’re flawless then people will bully that. 

But don’t be one of the bullies, be respectful to people. Please? Thank you.","Let’s talk about comfort characters, shall we?

teenagers,I’m a badass and so are you,"I’m struggle with low self esteem and high anxiety. Every day is a struggle. But I’m going to try something. I’m going to list 5 struggles I’ve had and why I’m a badass for overcoming them. 

• My mother’s religious organization disowned me for having romantic interests in someone at school when I was 13. I’m a badass because I’m 19 and married to her now. 
• My mom tried kicking me out 4 times by the time I was 17. I’m a badass because I live in a nice apartment in a nice part of town while she lives in a trashy mobile home 30 minutes from the nearest grocery store. 
• All of my friends from school have fallen into drug and alcohol abuse, and most can’t hold a job. I’m a badass because I worked through my struggle with depression and came out on top, have never been drunk or high, and I’ve never left a job on someone else’s terms (excluding being furloughed because of covid)
• I’ve never been taught budgeting, taxes, or had any kind of financial advise from a parent, teacher, so on etc. I’m a badass because I’ve never once been late on a payment, or did not have a budget I’ve failed to stick with, and my only debt is the loan for my car. 
• I have horrible anxiety issues, and have only a couple of real friends. Meeting people is always a chore, and I have been in and out of therapy, misdiagnosed, prescribed the wrong medication for it, and still occasionally have anxiety attacks. I’m a badass because I spent 18 months in car sales, and used the social skills I learned there to push my own social boundaries, now I flirt with waitresses relatively comfortably (we’re ethically non monogamous)

teenagers,Why do parents do this? Or is it just mine?,"I'm suck and tired of my anxiety being confused as bad attitude then getting yelled at for it. Like, that doesn't fucking help.

I couldn't find a box knife my dad needed so I like started tearing up and freaking out because he always gets mad at me and chews me out when I lose stuff. It causes my anxiety to go through the roof. I try to tell him that's why I'm freaking out and he says that's bullshit. I keep crying and he keeps making me feel worse.

It always just ends with me in my bed crying all night.

Any advice on coping mechanisms to make me feel better? Or tips on how to deal with situations like these?

Thank you reddit fam ❤️","Why do parents do this? Or is it just mine? I'm suck and tired of my anxiety being confused as bad attitude then getting yelled at for it. Like, that doesn't fucking help.

teenagers,Instagrams Pedophilia Problem.,"So I recently stumbled across numerous accounts on instagram that claim to be young girls (usually 14 to 16) selling their own nudes and photos to older men using cash app and amazon gift cards. I was scrolling through my explore page about a week ago when I started to notice these random shoutout pages amongst the hundreds of memes, or tiktoks that I was watching on the daily. They typically promoted girls and other tiktokers that were around my age (17) while also occasionally posting younger girls that looked to be about 12. It wasn’t until 3 days ago that I would stumbled across one of the most disturbing accounts that I have ever seen. It was another shoutout page...except they were posting images of teens as young as 14 in their bras, underwear, and even censored photos of them completely naked with captions that promoted the selling of their nude photos. I clicked on many of the accounts the page promoted in hopes that reporting them would help even a little bit. Every time I did, instagram claimed there had been no violation of its TOS. Even the page that had the censored NUDE PHOTOS OF PRETEENS was not taken down or seriously reviewed. The accounts of the girls selling their explicit photos followed hundreds of other accounts doing the same thing. They had bios that stated they were selling their bodies for cash and would even post preview photos of them in bikinis showing their butt or breasts. It’s absolutely inexcusable that instagram has yet to crackdown on these Child Pornography rings and it’s absolutely devastating that I and many others can barely do anything about this.","Instagrams Pedophilia Problem.

teenagers,"Mom doesn’t let me buy a headset, even tho she lets my brother buy his thing","Alright, so I’m a VR fanatic. (By that I mean I’ve owned 6 or 7 headsets) you could imagine how fucking exited I was when I heard that the “Oculus Quest 2” launched! I asked my mom if I could get it if I sold another headset. She said yes. I sold my Oculus rift Cv1 so I could buy my sweet sweet quest 2. Then we get to the store, I have the last box in my hand, and she says no. I say why, she respond with “it’s just too expensive hunny”. From me being a teen with a job (1400 plus in the bank) She reasonably should have let me buy the headset. Now my entire life I’ve felt like the least important kid. Still do. When my older brother sells his Nintendo switch, so he can buy a “New exclusive limited edition” version for 300. He sells his old switch for 225. And mom allows him to buy his new switch. The Headset I want to buy costs, guess. 300. I sell my headset for 300 FUCKING DOLLARS, and she doesn’t let me buy it. I have more money in the bank than him as well. He only has a better gpa than me. I’m a better gamer, athlete and human, and she rejects me. Sorry, had to vent.

teenagers,My mum...,"My mum just kicked out my brother 2 weeks after kicking out my dad. And honestly, those two were the only protection I had from her. My sister's moving out soon so I'll be alone, with a psychopath, until I can go to university. I can't say anything to her because then she'll scream at me and hold it over me forever like she did with her ""SuPeR-dA"" when her and my dad fought. It's not serious enough to talk to the police to, because she's only really screaming and making me feel bad and calling names, and I have no proof anyway cuz she only does it coincidentally when my phones gonna die and can't record. Staying full time at my dads isn't an option because of the hours he works and I'm too young to stay there alone. I can't sit in my room because then she'll get suspicious and start checking my phone and taking it out of my room so I can't talk to him about anything. She was crying after screaming at my bro, she's telling my aunt now what's happening. I've been keeping it in small notes but I need to share this. What can I do y'all? I haven't a clue what else is possible, and I'm starting to lose hope in getting out of here in any form before the next 7 years are up. I tried to start going to my mates house more but she wouldn't let me. She let me go once but then she won't let me go anymore. Once a fortnight maybe. Help?","My mum...

teenagers,Posting evil facts about historical figures you love until I stop being a cynical asshole day 64: Georgy Zhukov,"Zhukov was once a humble Russian peasant who went on to attend the most prestigious military academies and then become one or the greatest generals of the Second World War. Any HOI player knows how awesome he was. Although, many say that war is an omelette, and the generals are the ones cracking the eggs.

There's no doubt that Zhukov was a great general, but he had a weak point. Analysts of the war say that he had a habit of believing himself so great that no general could possibly be better than him. As a result, he was a little more careless in the earlier days of the war as a result of overvaluing himself.

In the late days of the war, there were incidents of Soviet troops raping large numbers of German women. While the general did not do this himself, he didn't really hold it against the ones who did.","Posting evil facts about historical figures you love until I stop being a cynical asshole day 64: Georgy Zhukov Zhukov was once a humble Russian peasant who went on to attend the most prestigious military academies and then become one or the greatest generals of the Second World War.

teenagers,“Daily Log” #3,"I might make two “logs” today. I want to talk about a few topics. 

Anyways today’s topic is going to be.... relationships!! Specifically, romantic relationships.

I’ve never had one. Never really wanted one. I don’t really get the appeal. I mean- I don’t even have any friends. 

Even if someone was interested in me (which is impossible) I probably wouldn’t choose to be in a “relationship” with them. 

I don’t envy those in relationships. And I don’t feel particularly sad or mad about not being in one. I may be in one in the future but I don’t really know.

Same thing with marriage. I don’t see myself ever getting married. Of course it’s hard to tell since I’m still a teen, but the idea just doesn’t seem to fit with my ‘plan for the future’.","“Daily Log” #3 I might make two “logs” today. I want to talk about a few topics.

teenagers,New dog but I can’t help but miss our old dog,"The second day of March this year my old dog had passed away from certain complications which eventually deteriorated her to much. I won’t get into that though. She had an entirely new personality once she got sick, and this lasted for close to half a year. Anyway once she passed I feel that I handled her passing the best amongst my family members, even though I am the youngest. I was no longer sad for her but instead grateful for the memories after about a week. However now 10 months later once we got our new dog I can’t help but miss her so much. I do not resent our new dog in anyway but I just feel so upset about our old dog. I had not felt this sadness for around 9 months. Can anyone help me with some advice?","New dog but I can’t help but miss our old dog The second day of March this year my old dog had passed away from certain complications which eventually deteriorated her to much.

That night I saw Josh staring at me and touching his beard . 

Anyways now we are chatting through social , and he ALWAYS compliments me . I compliment him too cause I really like him and he is so kind but also shy  . He's never been in a relationship before ( we are all in the same age 19 ) .

There's no way of meeting him cause of lockdown(they say that it might last till half of December )

I don't want to ask him out because  
1)I don't want to ruin my friendship with Joanna since she might think that I'm only hanging out with her cause of Josh ( I really appreciate her)
2) I don't want to do it and if I do he probably tell it to Joanna 😂

teenagers,I [19M] suspect my girlfriend [18F] is selling her pictures,"I'll give you little bit of context before I dive into what makes me feel that ways.

My girlfriend and I do not live together but she does spend a lot of time at my house. 3 months ago she was temporarily laid off her job as a waitress because of the pandemic. She has since been unemployed. She doesn't share a good relationship with her parents so going back to their house was not an option. I have asked her if she wants to temporarily move in with me so that she can sustain but she said she's doing okay and she has the money to pay her rent and stuff. Now it is a very normal thing for any person to have funds saved for a few months but my girlfriend isn't like that. She lived paycheck to paycheck, always spending almost everything she made on new clothes and shoes and whatnot. So this was the first thing that had me confused, her source of money. She wouldn't ask her parents to send money either. But anyway, this was not a big thing in itself.

This happened a week ago: She has deactivated her personal instagram since some time now but when she was at my place her phone buzzed a few times with Instagram message notification. Since she may have kept her settings private, the notification did not show any contents of the message. But it was weird as she has her IG deactivated and doesn't have any other accounts to my knowledge. This was the 2nd thing that bugged me.

And I don't usually doubt or get insecure but I felt weird. I don't know what hit me the other day, I caught hold of her laptop while she was away to look for that Instagram account. I did not find anything. I don't know why I did it, but the next thing I searched in her history was OnlyFans. There were a lot of links to articles about how to open one, how the money thing works, etc. I know this isn't much as even I have googled what OnlyFans was a few months ago when it was newish just to get an idea of what it is about.

Her and I sometimes sext. Now earlier I had to ask her to click sexy pictures for me and she rarely ever did it with enthusiasm. But since a month or so whenever we naughty text, she always has something NICE to send to me. And it's not the normal titty picture. They are good pictures, pictures that take a little time to click.

To summarize the reasons for me doubting her:
1. She has some source of income even after she is not working
2. She has a fake IG account and she's not using it only to browse. She gets texts on it
3. She was researching about OnlyFans and how it works
4. She always has nice nudes ready to send these days.

All of these 4 things separately do not really make a case, but then all of them are happening together.

Now I don't know what to do and how to proceed. My first thought was to try and find the username to her IG and text her from a throwaway account, try to talk and see where it goes. My 2nd thought was to just confront her but I am sure I don't have enough proof.

I want to find the truth out but at the same time I don't wanna know if it's true. I'll probably break up with her if it's true and I don't wanna lose her.","I [19M] suspect my girlfriend [18F] is selling her pictures I'll give you little bit of context before I dive into what makes me feel that ways.

teenagers,My thoughts on the 1 year anniversary of my first breakup,"1.) I'm a hopeless romantic 
2.) just let me die already 
3.) being a fuck buddy is probably the dream.

The biggest trouble is that I know that all of these thoughts are things that most people have gone through and lived. I know that I'll probably make it, too, but that makes the hardship just more infuriating. Every ""logical"" train of thought always always always goes back to ""well nothing matters so just chin up and be happy"".

Any of y’all have any tips on how to deal with it? The only advice my family gives me is to act like my opinions don’t matter and let her win every single argument. I’ve done this before and all it did was make me try to commit suicide at the end of the month. The other day when she made me have the biggest mental breakdown of my life my mom made her promise to not fuss at me anymore. I raise my voice ONE TIME and that rule suddenly doesn’t exist. 

I’m genuinely considering never going over there ever again even though I need the money. She’s making my life 100x harder and I’m already the only person who does chores at my house, and her house, and I’m in advanced classes.

Any of y’all have any tips on how to deal with it? The only advice my family gives me is to act like my opinions don’t matter and let her win every single argument. I’ve done this before and all it did was make me try to commit suicide at the end of the month. The other day when she made me have the biggest mental breakdown of my life my mom made her promise to not fuss at me anymore. I raise my voice ONE TIME and that rule suddenly doesn’t exist. 

I’m genuinely considering never going over there ever again even though I need the money. She’s making my life 100x harder and I’m already the only person who does chores at my house, and her house, and I’m in advanced classes. For the love of god someone just tell me how tf I can survive."

teenagers,How do I get over someone that I should be over already,"There's a lot of context that would be too long to share, so here's the short version of everything:

Met a girl in this class, she's really nice and we talk on occasion. Over time we talk a bit more and naturally I developed a crush on her. However, after a few months the amount we talked started to go down. Nothing bad happened (as far as I know) to make that happen, but we just kind of drifted apart despite not quite being friends yet. So yeah, that kind of hurt a little bit but not too much since we weren't close at all. I figured what needed to happen was to just let that happen so I could go back to not having a crush on her. And then... Corona. 

It was a very abrupt ending to my senior year, so for a lot of things I didn't really get a sense of closure. And, my feelings never really got any sense of closure either. We never talked outside of school, so trying to contact her during the quarantine wouldn't work for several reasons.

You'd think after months of not having any sort of contact with her that I'd be well over her, right? I thought I would to, but I still think about her a lot. Probably more than I should. But damn, I really, really did like her. She was just about as ideal as it could get for me.

I couldn't tell her now even if I wanted to (and even if I could, I still wouldn't). I don't want to try to find someone else to help me move on because a) that's just kind of wrong, and b) I've had a hard time meeting anyone lately, so I doubt I would meet anyone anytime soon (for a few reasons itself). I've tried letting time sort it out on its own but that hasn't worked either. Sometimes I think of her less often but lately it's been strong 

I don't know what I'm supposed to do. There's no way we could ever get to talking again or end up together, I've already accepted that. But I still can't stop thinking about her after all this time. What do I do?","How do I get over someone that I should be over already There's a lot of context that would be too long to share, so here's the short version of everything:

a year or two ago r/drama (which is now banned) used a bot to ban a ton of r/teenagers so they 'didn't have a bunch of zoomers running around' their sub or whatever

the ban message they used for this was just one word: 'underaged.' they got a *ton* of fucking ban appeals from people that claimed to be around the 40+ age range

at the same time tho when they checked the profiles of those people claiming to be 40+, *all* of them portrayed themselves as teens, and a number of them were the people constantly posting about being horny and shit

this sub is a fucking pit tbh","i feel like some people tend to underestimate how many pedos are on this sub if you're one of them and you're reading this i'm calling your ass out smh

teenagers,Showers &gt; baths,"Alr so on Wednesday someone on this sub said baths &gt; showers and one of their reasons was because it “uses less water” so i pledged to prove him wrong

In the end the water only went up to my ankles. That includes the cold water that came out before the hot water.

teenagers,"So, I was temporarily banned from my friends Minecraft server","I got banned from my friends survival SMP for stealing, and then caught them stealing. They stole my sword that I had just made, said it had the same enchantments as the stolen one, and then when they realized I knew it wasn't, they said it had the same name.

teenagers,I destroyed the IT guy at my school,"One day during lunch I went on the school laptop to watch anime on 9anime.to. When I opened the site it said it was blocked by (enter school name here). I then spent the last remaining 30 minutes of my break trying to find other websites that weren’t blocked. They were all blocked. Once I arrived home I assumed that because I was on a different wifi network then I could access the anime. I could not. The next day I asked the IT guy to unblock the sites, he refused. So then I got an idea, what if I used Tor Browser to block the bot from blocking 9anime? I went to the Tor website to find that it was blocked as well, so then I downloaded Tor on another computer, emailed it to the school computer and downloaded it. I tried moving it to applications so I could use it but I needed a password for that so I moved it to desktop instead. Now I can watch anime in peace. 

He tried to stop me but he couldn’t.","I destroyed the IT guy at my school One day during lunch I went on the school laptop to watch anime on 9anime.to.

teenagers,My parents just had a kind of big argument,"It was about money. I'm so tired of it I want one of them to just win the lottery or something. Every end of the month when we get bills they were expensive and because if COVID where everyone is home using the lights and electricity and wifi all at once it's even worse. My parents' insurance went up it was like 100 dollars monthly now the company wants to increase it to 500 dollars monthly, my parents think theyre doing this because of COVID. Now my parents had to cancel that insurance. Everything seems so expensive whoever invented the idea of currency I wish they just didn't. We wouldn't have problems like this if everything was free. My parents stopped arguing but I can tell they're still upset, the issue was not really resolved yet, and I'm just sad because  it's unfair that all these companies are raising prices for bills at a time when so many people are vulnerable financially. They don't know how stressful they're making households or maybe they know but they just don't care. It's so annoying I wish everyone would just not pay their bills until companies are forced to put the prices back to pre-COVID levels this is ridiculous.","My parents just had a kind of big argument It was about money.

We started being quarantine since the middle of march here,and we still like this, Pretty much will stay until a vaccine came out.
Frist of all,due to ""economic problems"" Brazil has,some people on school still don't have access to the internet,so the schools are just sending activities and  school subjects via pdf,or printed for the ones that don't can afford internet.So we end up not having online classes, meaning that most of us are only interacting with the people who live with us since march.I was ok with this to be honest,I was never been sociable actually,never had close friends irl and usually would prefer play games and watch anime at home than go out on common days,so i was very good until last month.
I started to manifest myopia last months,I already started wearing glasses and I am fine now,but I needed to pass like one month without using any device with non-natural light, meaning that I could not make anything I like during these days,I was fine on the start,but after some time I started to think about the status of my life,and the ""High school"" Animes I watched not helped,I started to have an anxiety crises,thinking I was wasting my youth/my school years sitting around home all day,even before the pandemic,I felt like I was losing the best time of my life and I felt horrible I couldn't even sleep at night ,I even cried out of nowhere.I already back to my games and anime right now and I am better,but I still overthinking about this and getting anxiety and insomnia about it ever once in a while, anyway,I would like to have what you guys have to say about it, anyone has been on this kind of situation before?How you dealt with it?","I just want to talk about my time in quarantine.

teenagers,I went out today..,"I was getting sick and tired of being cooped up in my room for months and I just needed fresh air, this year was quite something and I'm praying that next year will be a bit better. 


But anyway, I walked around the neighborhood, the streets were quiet even though there was a house on fire and I'm pretty sure there were people in it, the location was clean. Saw familiar faces like my friends and one of them is 3 weeks pregnant, good for her, she always wanted a baby, she had artificial insemination and I stan her for that, she's three years younger than me, she's so brave ✨ I'm proud.


Most of them are going to uni and I'm the only one who is going to a college [College of the arts] but this days, I start to wonder what's the point of going to college, I don't have a career plan, I'm not motivated to do anything... might as well study graphics, get a job, move out blah blah...

teenagers,The time a joke was taken seriously,"Crap - how a simple joke spirals.


So this this story goes back a couple years while I was dating this girl we will call Lily (that is not her name). This relationship was nearing 2 years but was very very stale the girl was neglectful and it wasn’t going anywhere. I felt trapped in it because this girl I was going to break up with was in the hospital about a month before so I didn’t want to be a huge asshole and break it up.  Anyways around this time I met a neighbor of my age who was pretty friendly and kind 
Who we will call Elsa (that isnt her name either. Anyway we didnt talk often but about 6 months and I didnt have any kind of crush. later that summer my former Girlfriend broke up with me and it was a big weight off of both of our shoulders. I still didnt have a crush on anyone but my parents were trying to get me to ask her out for some reason. I jokingly tell my friends about my parents urges and they thought I was talking about one of my younger neighbors. My friends start a long running joke about Elsa calling her my 4 year old neighbor. The joke lasted for years and more of my friend group heard about it. Finally the fateful day my friend liam met the girl at the park by total happenstance and we add her to a discord group chat. Another friend close to my old GF started DMing this girl thinking the joke is real. So she starts gossiping to her about how I deeply like this girl. At this point she has a boyfriend so she finds this story to be odd. Anyways the friend who we will call Allysa sets up an entire hang out so scripted in order to hint to me that she isnt into me. The truth is that I am most definitely not the girl was too much like my last GF. Anyways I being elsas friend invites her to friend hangouts to be nice and she thinks I was trying to ask her out. Elsas friend texted me that Elsa didn’t want to talk to me anymore because she thought I was being weird. So that is how a simple long lasting  joke about your parents and mixing friend groups leads to shit.","The time a joke was taken seriously Crap - how a simple joke spirals.

He sent me her photo and she is like a 7-8 and she's really pretty.

I am 60% sure that its not a prank. He will call me tomorrow morning to tell me the whole thing.

I am gonna die from happiness!!! I am literally shaking from happiness rn. 

Also, she most probably lives in a nearby city where I go to school and its closed due to covid. I was planning move to that city after the schools will open.

teenagers,I've done it.,"I've perfected skipping school due to the lockdown.

As you all know, most schools don't actually require you to be there on the days you need to. Say if you have to go 2 days a week, you can just stay home those 2 days and just chill at home. Yet, not everyone's parents are as lenient. What you have to do is, as soon as you make it to the school, just leave through another entrance that no one is near, and book it to the nearest street. You can either from this point, go to a friend's house, or just move around coffee shops with your Chromebook. It's worked for me.","I've done it. I've perfected skipping school due to the lockdown.

teenagers,I am tired of people saying they hate this country.,"You do not hate this country. You hate government corruption, police force corruption, and public lack of education.

The main thing being a lack of public education. Honestly, if the public was educated on corruption that takes place in the government we would have MUCH less corruption.

If you say you hate this country, you are generalizing the entire country, and that is wrong. You hate certain parts of the country. I can’t say that I hate the Honda Civic when it benefits me in every way, yet I dislike the gas mileage and it’s smell.

This country is great, there’s just areas that are shit. So many of us are doing ok, and there are so many benefits for those that are unemployed, military veterans, etc. It just requires hard work in order to get out of a bsd situation.

There’s still racial injustice in many ways, but fuck people of all color can still make it, even if they were disadvantaged because of their color, and that’s where the fault is. We’re working towards that change, and getting minorities out of the hood where they were forced by rich white people to join gangs and sell drugs in order to live.

There’s problems in every country, but there’s so much more good here than bad.","I am tired of people saying they hate this country. You do not hate this country. You hate government corruption, police force corruption, and public lack of education.

teenagers,2020 can apparently always get worse,"In 2019 when I was in Highschool and about to finish school I had big hopes for college lifestyle. I would travel with my friends alone for at least a month and I will be driving because I would have had passed my driving test. I would travel to a new country to attend my University, meet new people, party every weekend be independent from my parents, drink alcohol freely(the drinking age in my country is 21 but in the country where I will be moving to, to attend my University it is 18). But 2020 had other plans for me. I stayed at home for almost 6 month without even meeting my friends. But at least after staying 6 month in my home I was able to travel because the country I wanted to travel to lifted its flight restrictions for students. After 3 weeks in my new and apartment mostly staying indoors. A new lockdown emerged. For two weeks I only  left my apartment for grocery shopping. At the end of the 2nd week I felt sick and I suffered from very strong pain in my abdominal area. After the pain got unbearable I called an ambulance. I was given pain killers and transported to a hospital. They did check ups on my abdominal area and came to the conclusion that my appendix is the infected. So I was scheduled for an operation to remove my appendix the next day. Turn out it was worse my appendix had a hole and it had infected other parts as well mainly my stomach. So I have to stay now at least four days alone in a hospital bed in pain without any visitation because of corona. I am currently in day 1 and I have already missed my parents a lot(I never thought I would miss my parent that much) and feel like I am in bad nightmare. What should have been one of my best years turned out to be a fucking nightmare.","2020 can apparently always get worse In 2019 when I was in Highschool and about to finish school I had big hopes for college lifestyle.

teenagers,I just came out to my mum and I don’t know how it went.,"So I’ve been secretly bi for around 3 months now and the reason is because I don’t have the balls to tell anyone except my mates. Anyways I came out to my mum today and I wasn’t ready and to be honest I don’t know how it went.

So basically what happened is my mum walked into my room when I just had a mental breakdown from bullying (I’ve been bullied quite harshly the past couple of months) so I looked like I had been crying. Anyways my mum walked into my room and luckily I looked like when I said to my mum I had depression (which also didn’t go too well) and she asked what was wrong. I won’t bore you with the details but basically what happened was she managed to get me to say I was bi and she reacted in the most unexpected way.

What she said is that I can either be gay or straight and said there’s no in between so now she thinks I’m sexually confused instead of being mad at me like I thought she would be. I can’t tell if it went well or not though. Anyways it was good to get it off my chest at least and the reason I was nervous is because she is an old time “there’s no such thing as being gay” person.","I just came out to my mum and I don’t know how it went.

teenagers,Just want to vent some of my feelings.,"I know many people joke about depression and some genuinely have it and still joke about it. But I'm currently actually worried about my mental health. I have been brought up in a fairly good family for talking about mental health so I've always known to keep an eye on not just my physical health but mental too.

Recently I've been going downhill just thinking about life. I've lost all interest in doing anything at all but at the same time feel constantly bored. I am constantly exhausted and feel empty. Even thinking about this I still can't be bothered cuse I've started getting to the point I don't like myself. I try act happy around others  but it's starting to show I'm not truly happy and people are becoming worried. There's a girl I like too, she's said she has feelings for me and yes, it's the only happy bit about my life at the moment but I don't know whether to let her in because of how much of a mess I am. I don't know whether to talk to her about it or keep trying to hide it. You don't have to care. I just wanted to vent some stuff before it becomes too much.

Well I'm kinda addicted to them hehe so any places I could find them would be muy bien. Preferably an Instagram page or something, but anywhere is fine really. Or just what they're called in general?

Sorry if this makes no sense btw I am very tired ;)))","Anyone know where I can find those badly edited Facebook memes? Hopefully you know the ones I mean,,, they're like text posts with a color/emoji background and people cover up and replace words to make it depressing/funny?

teenagers,I did something I’m starting to regret.,"Basically if you don’t know I’ve recently started using r/Teenagers and there was a post on there today talking about how this one kids mom died from COVID-19 just before thanksgiving and how he was upset by it and ask asking for support from his lose, so as you’d expect people on there were mainly say things like “I feel bad for you op” or “I hope you get better op” etc, but whenever there was a comment that looked like religious proselytizing I attacked the commenter saying things like “shut up you stupid Christian stop trying to take advantage of the death of someone’s family member and proselytizing people” this got mixed reactions lots of people think I was “sh**y” for doing that and I made more comments out of pure built up rage inside me saying that “your mother is dead and rotting now get over it it happened to me” I really regretted saying that and when I looked back at what I said I was on the verge of tears and saw myself as a monster, and then lots of people defended the Christians/Muslims who made the comments like “may she rest in heaven” and not my reply’s where I said “you you don’t care if op’s mother loses all her humanity just to endlessly worship a narcissistic tyrant for all eternity!?”

And if anyone wants to know why I felt so angry it’s because I felt betrayed by my father, yesterday (thanksgiving) was horrible for me I felt like I was stabbed in the back by someone who respected and looked up to me, he to,d me a while back that he was planning to have a big feast with me (I was excited off course) that I could spend a holiday with him but then he told me i apparently “didn’t tell him” to go get food so we couldn’t do it even though I sent him a message in the afternoon to do it that’s when I realized that he wasn’t wanting to so anything with me he lied and betrayed me just so he could be with someone else he knew and I felt betrayed and bitter and angry by this I felt like he didn’t care so my entire day yesterday was miserable I began to hate myself and take my anger out on other people I did I didn’t know (I have anger issues) but when I saw what I’d said and did I I felt disgusted with myself I feel worthy and empty inside like a mannequin with no stuffing or a pie with no filling, I honestly regret what I did and dint even think I can sleep tonight

teenagers,Why is my (F17) mom (F38) always trying to set me up on dates and get new friends?,"Ever since my boyfriend of three years broke up with me my sophomore year of high school, when I was 15, my mom has been determined to find me a boyfriend.

She never liked my ex, but not because he did anything illegal or mistreat me, she just didn’t find him attractive enough for me or liked his family. He took care of his older autistic brother a lot, since his brother wasn’t able to be independent and had numerous special needs, and my mom feared that I would have to take on the role of caretaker one day if I stayed with him. However, my ex was the sweetest guy in the world. Always kind, generous, and could make anyone laugh. He only broke up with me because he discovered that he wasn’t attracted to females, but we left on good terms.

Ever since the breakup, my mom would be pressuring me to date, but it would be on her terms. When I would find someone and go on a date with them, she would instantly hate it. When she would find someone, and I mean anyone, she would pressure me to do it. One time we were inside TacoBell ordering food and she called over the manager, asking him to date me. The poor guy hid in the back of the restaurant the entire time until we left. 

It’s extremely embarrassing. She recently said that she would try to pair me up with a guy at her work. The problem is, ever since COVID-19 hit, I’ve been working at the same place as my mom. More than half the staff quit when COVID hit and the owner, my mom’s boss, badly needed people so the owner gave me permission to work there. My mom is the manager and I’m essentially the manager’s daughter. This is when she started trying to find me friends. 

She calls me over to new employees to greet them, which goes great at first, then she blurts out that I’m her daughter and everything instantly goes sour. People don’t want to associate with the manager’s daughter and her telling them that I’m related to her decreases my chances of making friends. The only person that really clicked with me was this amazing guy, but he’s autistic and my mom said that she thinks I could do better with getting friends and we have very differing schedules, so we can’t see each other often now. He’s so awesome, but that boat has sailed because he doesn’t really talk to me anymore when I try to make conversation with him. 

Ever since my mom entered middle school, she always had boyfriends and never was not in a relationship. I can’t remember a time when my mom wasn’t dating anyone, I literally can’t. I feel like she’s disappointed in me that I’m not as good as her. 

People just don’t seem to like me, but I think her always trying to pair me up with friends and dates is making the situation worse. I’ve already accepted that I would be alone for the rest of my life when it comes to romance, and I’ve told her this and to please stop, but she won’t listen. I want at least some friends, but it’s so hard to find any when people don’t want to associate with you.

teenagers,Haha people don't care about my existence.,"People I talk to on like a daily basis have literally just stopped talking to me. And I have this one person I talk to daily but he just seems off. And people don't notice me and if they do I'm told to shut up.

Keep in mind these people are online because life gave me anxiety and I'm socially awkward. Lovely","Haha people don't care about my existence.

teenagers,"time capsule post, because why not? (for the person that made this, open on 2.12.2021)","to anyone wondering, a time capsule post is basically something where you predict your life situation/something else for a given point in the future and save it and only look at it again until that given day you set. you have to set a reminder. with that out if the way,

i will turn 14 on the day of me opening this.

i will have come outto my parents, and i will have found that i can absolutely be more open about myself.

i will have been elected as class president for the 2nd time in a row.

i will be in 8th grade, with better than average grades.

i will have put atleast one of my rather bogus concepts into reality.

i will have finished my diorama.

i will have gotten a good start on my continiuation of a popular anime series that i will mention once the time has come.

i will have solved the spider issue with my room.

i will have a new bed, and much more storage space.

these arr my goals, and hopefully, i can fullfill all of these. i reccomend the people reading this to also save it and set a reminder so they can see if i made progress. i might also do an update post for this when the time is there.","time capsule post, because why not?

teenagers,I think my family thinks I’m an autistic muscle head AND a weak incel. Why do they think that?,"My family thinks that they have to remind me not to hurt little kids when playing with them like I would ever do that? Then when electronics come up they think I’m on my computer for up to 5 hours on end, when in reality I’m only on it for one hour or two. I believe it may be because of my autism, but my autism is high functioning autism (Aspergers), but even that wouldn’t make me act in such a way. Why do they think this? Am I overreacting?","I think my family thinks I’m an autistic muscle head AND a weak incel. Why do they think that?

teenagers,Bro i hate that i love running and working out.,"My fingers are shaking, its hard to type, impossible to draw. My arms don't want to keep holding on. Walking hurts my legs. My lungs hurt, and my heart is pounding. I say I'd never do this again, but I'm going to just do it again tomorrow. *I'm in love with the pain~*

yeah swear it hurts tho, and idk if the shaking is normal, I'd actually call it twitching slightly or shivering.","Bro i hate that i love running and working out.

teenagers,Got kicked out of class for the first time and I just want to cry,"So, just arrived home after getting kicked out of the classroom for the most stupid thing in the world.

So to start off this story, I am in 8th grade and I am a shy person, so in class I rarely talk ( also because I dont get along with the guys around me). Also I am the child of two professors that work in the same school where I study.

So it was PE class (45 minutes) but, because of the 'rona, we have 45 minute classes in a classroom. Everyone was tired, last class of the week and for no reason, this teacher always picks on the people that are in front of his desk (and, unfortunately, I'm one of them). So I was putting down the shutters because it was already night and the ""fight"" starts:

Teacher: What do you think you are doing!? Why are you putting down the shutters for no reason?

Me: \*starts to putting up shutters\*

Teacher: Get out of the class!

Me: Why??? What did I do?????

Teacher: I dont care, get out!!!

So yeah, I went off the classroom with my eyes wanting to cry but my mind was saying no, you cant embarass yourself in front of the whole class. Atleast the rest of my class are going to say to my class director that it wasnt my fault but I still did not say anything to my parents about its soo I'm screwed","Got kicked out of class for the first time and I just want to cry So, just arrived home after getting kicked out of the classroom for the most stupid thing in the world.

So to start off this story, I am in 8th grade and I am a shy person, so in class I rarely talk ( also because I dont get along with the guys around me). Also I am the child of two professors that work in the same school where I study.

So it was PE class (45 minutes) but, because of the 'rona, we have 45 minute classes in a classroom. Everyone was tired, last class of the week and for no reason, this teacher always picks on the people that are in front of his desk (and, unfortunately, I'm one of them). So I was putting down the shutters because it was already night and the ""fight"" starts:

Teacher: What do you think you are doing!? Why are you putting down the shutters for no reason?

Me: \*starts to putting up shutters\*

Teacher: Get out of the class!

Me: Why??? What did I do?????

Teacher: I dont care, get out!!!

So yeah, I went off the classroom with my eyes wanting to cry but my mind was saying no, you cant embarass yourself in front of the whole class. Atleast the rest of my class are going to say to my class director that it wasnt my fault but I still did not say anything to my parents about its soo I'm screwed"

teenagers,Reality rant,"Guys. I'm sorry if this offends you, or you downvote this all the way to hell, but idc anymore. Gen z needs to realize that it's going south at a fast pace. 1. Defunding the police. How is that a Good Idea? like, think about this, Imagine the police do get defunded, then suddenly, someone breaks into your (or your parents) house, who are you gonna call? not the police apparently, because they don't have the proper equipment. And, Ik you guys are gonna say ""Oh, it's not the police, it's the system."" but I don't think that giving them less money to work on will make that system any better. 2. Trump vs. Biden and America's state rn. Imma just say it rn and you guys can get mad, but Trump won, fair and square. It doesn't take a scientist to see where he won and how. It's so easy to see that so many counts cheated. Lemme make it easier to process: there are two people, 1 democrat and 1 republican. their job is to watch all the ballots get counted and verify them. This year though, the democrats didn't let the republicans have the dude that counts, be there! It can't get any more obvious than that. That gives the democrats such an easy way to fuck the whole thing up. There is so much evidence to prove my claim. Between 12-5 am there was an INSANE spike in Biden votes and Trump just stayed down low.  The worst part about all of this is that this is nationally embarrassing. Now, if Biden won, everyone would accept it. But the thing is is that you can take one look and say ""Oh it's rigged as hell"". Now if Biden even gets to the office, he won't even stay in for a year without having to be taken out and replaced with Kamala. That is bad. Now, you might think I hate women or are racist but that doesn't have anything to do with it. If you've seen some of her meetings/debates, you can tell, personally, how evil and demonic she is. Take a look at china. You cant have a voice or they will put you to jail, or even kill you. Would you want that? no. Then why would you be ok with Kamala in the office? I'm telling you, man, if the democrats stay with power in the office, America will start looking a lot like China, communistic. Walking away from Biden and Trump, let's look at America itself. Do you see how many Riots/protests are going on rn? and I'm not just talking about BLM or ACAB, even the patriotic people are starting to rebel. And the funny thing is that none of this was happening during the four years that Trump was in office! this has only had an upsurge recently! Trump has done so, SO much good for this country, I cant understand how these pro-left Genz people don't recognize it. 3. The future of America and where it'll go from the perspective of if the left is in the office, or the right. My parents have both fleed from pro-communist countries (Ukraine and Lithuania). The stupid thing is that basically ALL of these Genz/millenial people have never seen/experienced true communism. I promise you, if some of these people truly have seen what communism can do, they'll think twice about voting for Biden And Harris. If Trump wins (after the re-count), I, personally think, that this country will change for the absolute better. At the moment, the people that are making this country look bad are all these dumb, spoiled Genz kids that don't realize what privilege they have. Trump, when he's re-elected, will shut down those people faster than I can blink. From then on, much more good stuff will happen for the next four years (in the right perspective). If you read the whole thing, then thank you, so much. I've never really made a post ranting and pls lemme know If you liked it or hated it. Please only take this as my opinion on this topic, because people have been ignoring this and I think that people need to see the cold, hard, reality. Thank you","Reality rant Guys.

teenagers,Is it too early for me (13M) to get a girlfriend?,"I am 13 years old and doubting if I should get a girlfriend or not. I like this girl who likes me back, and we've been talking for a good time now. 

I dont know if I should ask her out, because now we're close and she said that she would accept if I ask her out. The problem is that I think we're too young as its almost impossible to stay with someone until I become and adult.


Other problems:
The way I will tell my friends and family (I've never had a gf before and if I do get one by family won't stop annoying me.

The problem I mentioned before (we're too young)

teenagers,I’m very luck this happened,I was on a video call with a close friend of mine who I met this year. We go to the same school and she’s a really beautiful and cool person but  she’s the type who rejects a lot. I was interested in her but I wasn’t sure if I had a chance so I was hesitant at first. Here we are on a video call talking and we are flirting with each other. I decided to ask her out and she said yes! She also told me that she was interested in me but was shy to tell me.,I’m very luck this happened I was on a video call with a close friend of mine who I met this year.

teenagers,What Girls Like In A Guy,"Hello teens of reddit! 14f here back with another try-to-be-big-brain advice post! Last night when I posted something similar, a few people seemed to find it helpful, so I'm back! Basically, this is what girls like in a guy. At least, most girls.

1. Appearance. So, appearance shouldn't be the most important thing, but it is pretty important. When you first meet someone, you know nothing about them. You don't know if they have a great sense of humor or a weird cough drop addiction. But you do know what they look like, so many people will judge off of that. And, just like guys don't usually go for girls they don't find attractive, girls usually wouldn't go for guys they don't find attractive. However, a lot of things (height, hair type, etc.) can't be controlled. But one thing can. You need to be presentable and neat. Don't look like you just crawled out of bed after a month-long nap. And honestly, that's just what it takes.
2. Be kind. Surprise!! This one should be obvious, but for some reason, some guys still act mean towards others in order to impress a girl...? Unless you're living in some messed up romance novel whose plot was written by a 12 year old girl, then that's a different story. Otherwise, be nice! :)
3. Respect. This one is kind of similar to 2, but a girl will obviously see how you interact with others, for example, your friends, your parents, your teachers, etc. And if she doesn't know you well, that's how she's going to judge you. And obviously, respect her.
4. Building off of 3, you need to make her feel like you care. I'm seeing way too many posts of guys being mad because no girls like them, yet admitting to spending all their time on games and things. Girls like guys who spend time with them and care for them.

Anyways, hope this helped! Peace &lt;3","What Girls Like In A Guy Hello teens of reddit! 14f here back with another try-to-be-big-brain advice post!

teenagers,Recruiting people to play Team Fortress 2 until valve gives us a major update or the bots go away. Day 17," 

The game is called Tf2 it's an FPS PC game made by the video game company Valve that also made the Half-life series. It's a really fun game. Main reason I am recruiting people is because if we can start increasing the monthly player number, Valve will get us an update or pay attention to us. Tf2 is a FPS game where there are different game modes such as payload, capture the point, king of the hill, and capture the intelligence. There are also alternative game modes where you can play with friends such as Mann vs. machine. If you don't feel like being a tryhard and playing the objective, you can hop into a 2fort or Hightower server and just mess around with friends.

As it stands now, it is a F2P, however F2P can't use the chat or voice chat. However this can be easily solved by buying a key at the Mann.co store in-game for 2.50 (U.S. dollars). After the purchase its up to you if you want to buy more stuff. It also gives you the privilege of going competitive if you want. You can also buy cosmetics (if you want) and dress your character. Many Tf2 veterans refer to this as a hat simulator because of the amount of hats and cosmetics there are (at least I do).

If you need help getting into the game or want more info, DM and I will be more than happy to respond. It would also help if you joined my newly created subreddit----&gt; [https://www.reddit.com/r/ReconstructingTf2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReconstructingTf2/) It's a subreddit dedicated to help reach out to new players and to reverse the inflation caused by the Crate Depression","Recruiting people to play Team Fortress 2 until valve gives us a major update or the bots go away.

(If you comment a genre, vibe, or anything you're looking for, I'll point you in the direction of the mix(es) I think is(are) best suited for you :)) Essentially, I've got a hobby for curating all sorts of playlists which I use everyday. One of my buddies recently switched from apple music to spotify, just to have access to these mixes, so I figured I'd repost them again here \^\^

teenagers,Me and me friends started a newsite and we're looking for journalists," Hey guys, so me and a few friends made a newsite ([www.travistribune.com](http://www.travistribune.com/)) a while back and we're looking for more journalists. It's relatively medium commitment. All you really need to do is write a one page or so article about whatever you want around once a week. We'll take care of the editing. It'll look good on college apps and is primarily for high school students.

teenagers,Age restriction on consoles?,"There should be an age restriction on consoles so we don’t have to listen to squeaky 5 year olds constantly repeating the word ‘n*gg*a’ better yet, their parents should respect that there’s ACTUALLY A RESTRICTION to gaming and that their child is too young for online gaming. But then again I’m not a parent and I think that everyone’s parenting tactics are different but still... I feel like the next generations of children are getting worse.","Age restriction on consoles?

teenagers,sad gorl hours,"I don't know where to begin... basically I just had a fight with my parents because they won't let me use the internet. I get like v e r y restricted hours of connection to the wifi, and it goes off before 11pm. I'm not allowed on social media either, and I understand that my parents are just looking out for me but what the fuck. 
anyway, my WiFi goes off in like 10 minutes and I confrunted my parents, trying to tell them that I'm a night person... I feel bad because I can't be there for my friends when they really need me. I can't go out- not even at my friend's place. 
I like writing, getting creative at night, and I need access to gadgets at that time. but they argue that this is what's ruining me. that you can't be successful unless you don't wake up at 5am and pray for two hours.they ridicule my choice of clothing, music, food... basically every fucking thing. sometimes I get as less as 3 hours of sleep because I don't want to upset them... I know I'm not a brilliant child, like they wanted me to be and I'm sorry. but why can't I just listen to music at night... why am I not allowed to socialize at all, especially during quarantine, they don't let me visit anyone. the other day I found out that my dad hacked into my gmail and got access to my entire gallery via google photos and my gmail subscriptions and...who knows what, which is extremely embarrassing and pretty controlling of them in my opinion. there's just so much I could go on forever, 
but maybe it's just my fault. 
maybe I should sleep early, study 24/7 and try harder for the next exams. maybe I shouldn't be listening to English music, should probably listen to some religious songs like my entire family does. 
anyway, my wifi time is getting over. who knows when will be the next time I get access to internet? 
if you read so far, I hope you have a great day ahead.

teenagers,to my friend who’s heart i have accidentally broken years ago,"i’m really sorry

i really didn’t mean to do that. looking back now, i feel really stupid for not realising you liked me for two years.

we met in the worst way possible. you bullied me to the point i felt so useless and stupid. you criticised every of my insecurities that i lost any self esteem i had. i avoided school and faked many illnesses just to avoid you in school. i don’t remember how, but we ended up being forced to talk to each other normally for a project, and we realised we had so much in common. 

although we became friends after a while, and chatted online almost 24/7, i was still wary of you. after all, it’s not easy to recover from those insults you’ve carelessly made. however, i still continued to be a nice friend, someone whom you could talk to about your problems, someone who could talk the most random topics for hours. it was fun, honestly. 

i didn’t realise it then, when you started to treat me differently from your other friends. you made so many pick up lines and flirting attempts but i was too dumb to notice it. in school, you would always look out for me first, and even offer any snacks you just bought to me before offering it to your guy friends. looking back, i realise i was really dumb because damn, those things you’ve said to me were pretty obvious that you had a crush on me. it was so obvious that everyone knew, which i only found this out years after.

i remember that day you confessed, 2 years after we met. i genuinely did not believe you, since there’s no way someone would like this disaster of a person. plus, you kinda had a track record of making fun of me, so i assumed it was a joke. so i did that worst thing ever. i laughed

from then on, we didnt have any classes together anymore. in the hallways, you would always ignore me. a while later, you dated someone before dumping her really fast. 

i only found out about everything after growing up to a more mature age. i forced my friends to tell me: apparently they all knew but assumed i knew hence they never talked about it. 

i regret this so much. i know you probably hate me now, since its been 2+ years and you haven’t contacted me. honestly if i were you, i would hate myself too

i know its been a long time, but i really wanted to vent so i can finally move on from this","to my friend who’s heart i have accidentally broken years ago i’m really sorry

teenagers,Anybody in here have DID?,"I hope this isn't crossing any lines, and I know I could ask r/DID, but I came here instead. I was just curious what it's like to have dissociative identity disorder as a teen. Ever since I watched Mr. Robot, it's been the one mental disorder that pokes my interest the most. Again, I hope this isn't crossing any lines. I am aware of how someone gets it, which is why I hope this doesn't piss off anybody. I'm just purely curious.

teenagers,My Grandfathers song :D,"Hey everyone, 
So as I’m sure you all know, Christmas is upon us and with that comes the various songs that we all know and love, so it is my pleasure to announce that my grandfather has just released a song of his own that he spent three months working on and is now finally open to the public!

He has been playing his saxophone since he was  12 and he is now 65 and still going strong. So it would mean a lot of you could give it a listen and possibly share it with your friends :D 

Here are the links to the song:

teenagers,"Recent Painful ""Graduation"" from the Subreddit"," 

Hey, guys... I'm Lillie. I've been lurking here for a few years, since I was about 15 or so. I have always been the shy type, so I... never interacted ): I'm very awkward, and bullying in school never really helped me learn how to socially interact... A year ago, I... guess the term could be graduated(?) from here after I turned 20. I know that anybody of any age is allowed to interact and talk, but... well, I'll just shut up about this, and get to the main point of the post.

&amp;#x200B;

Trigger Warnings: Being trans, suicide, severe depression... 

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of background first... I promise it will make sense afterwards.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I am transgender. Meaning, I am a girl. I have known this my entire life. I kept it secret as best I could, and apparently, I managed to do so flawlessly. Nobody ever expected it when I came out in October of 2015. I was met with a ton of criticism, but I also had a very few teens my age that accepted me. And to them, I will always be grateful.

I would always sit on the side throughout my life, and watch girls do things with other girls, while I was consistently paired with boys. And not good boys at that. From as early as memories are able to be recalled, I knew that I was truly a girl on the inside. I never knew how to tell anybody. How could I when I would constantly have family members indirectly talk about how disgusting I was? Some even talking about how they would kill people like me. All I was able to do was hide.

But eventually, I was unable to hide the fact that I was a female any longer. However, it was too late. I never got to experience a girl's childhood. I would go to school every day with a plan on how I would befriend the other girls in my class. I never succeeded ):

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now... to the actual point of the post... I am so... for a lack of better words... suicidal. It extends to yet another thing that I have hidden about myself, and what the main point of my post is. I only know of one person who is aware of it, and that is my mother. One day, at the age of nine years old, I came to the realization that I would not always be a kid. That I was one day going to turn eighteen, and I was currently halfway to that mark. I began to hyperventilate, and I started screaming in a panic attack. It was one of my largest fears. My mother ran into my room, and began to hold me as I was almost flailing in a state of pure confusion and fear. I have always been one to hide what is wrong with me, but in that moment, I simply told her. I told her how I was so incredibly fearful of growing up. How I detested the very idea. She told me, and I quote, ""you don't ever have to, baby. you can stay as my world forever."" I felt slight relief in that moment. However, I knew that regardless of her words, I would still eventually technically grow up.

Years would go on, and I would have other kids talk about how they dreamed of growing older. I would simply listen in nothing less than confusion. ""Why would anybody want to be a dumb adult?"" The thought petrified me. More time passed, and I began to grow more fearful of the ever approaching eighteenth birthday that I couldn't possibly delay. I didn't just have to go through a male puberty, no, I had to also go through the stages of growing up. That is to say, what was expected of me. But in the end, I would always secretly resist. I could tell that my mother had forgotten all about that night where I told her about my fear and dread of growing up. It was more than apparent that she only said those things because she knew I eventually would stop caring and fearing to grow up, not because she actually felt that she was okay with me staying as a child. I eventually promised myself that if I ever reached my eighteenth birthday, then I would... ): Well, the day surely arrived, and while I tried, it was futile against my other fear of death. Apparently, there are so many people who believe that all suicidal people do not fear death. Well, I can assure all of them that they are sorrily mistaken. Just because I want to die, is no indication that I do not fear the death itself. Regardless, the day did arrive, and while I smiled through the day, there was no present or celebration that could make my heart smile. It was my fear of growing up that had made me loath each and every one of my birthdays. Needless to say, this one was the worst of all.

The only difference, is the amount of depression, self hatred and fear that has accumulated within my soul as a result of being seen as older, and as a male. I am being treated as an adult more and more every single day.

\~ Lillie","Recent Painful ""Graduation"" from the Subreddit  

Hey, guys... I'm Lillie. I've been lurking here for a few years, since I was about 15 or so. I have always been the shy type, so I... never interacted ): I'm very awkward, and bullying in school never really helped me learn how to socially interact... A year ago, I... guess the term could be graduated(?) from here after I turned 20. I know that anybody of any age is allowed to interact and talk, but... well, I'll just shut up about this, and get to the main point of the post.

&amp;#x200B;

Trigger Warnings: Being trans, suicide, severe depression... 

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of background first... I promise it will make sense afterwards.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I am transgender. Meaning, I am a girl. I have known this my entire life. I kept it secret as best I could, and apparently, I managed to do so flawlessly. Nobody ever expected it when I came out in October of 2015. I was met with a ton of criticism, but I also had a very few teens my age that accepted me. And to them, I will always be grateful.

I would always sit on the side throughout my life, and watch girls do things with other girls, while I was consistently paired with boys. And not good boys at that. From as early as memories are able to be recalled, I knew that I was truly a girl on the inside. I never knew how to tell anybody. How could I when I would constantly have family members indirectly talk about how disgusting I was? Some even talking about how they would kill people like me. All I was able to do was hide.

But eventually, I was unable to hide the fact that I was a female any longer. However, it was too late. I never got to experience a girl's childhood. I would go to school every day with a plan on how I would befriend the other girls in my class. I never succeeded ):

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now... to the actual point of the post... I am so... for a lack of better words... suicidal. It extends to yet another thing that I have hidden about myself, and what the main point of my post is. I only know of one person who is aware of it, and that is my mother. One day, at the age of nine years old, I came to the realization that I would not always be a kid. That I was one day going to turn eighteen, and I was currently halfway to that mark. I began to hyperventilate, and I started screaming in a panic attack. It was one of my largest fears. My mother ran into my room, and began to hold me as I was almost flailing in a state of pure confusion and fear. I have always been one to hide what is wrong with me, but in that moment, I simply told her. I told her how I was so incredibly fearful of growing up. How I detested the very idea. She told me, and I quote, ""you don't ever have to, baby. you can stay as my world forever."" I felt slight relief in that moment.

She spoke to me today out of the blue asking me if I hate her and I said no of course. Why would I? And she said that I was being sarcastic and ruse to her particularly. I'm not like that with my dad.


The thing is my dad isn't gonna change his character. We just adjusted to be overly sweet with him because he hates when we're not sweet enough. Don't get me wrong, I can totally be real with my dad. I just have to add extra effort sometimes. 


My mom on the other hand is less sweet and is just fine where she is. We all get that and I got the same attitude. My dad calls us cold, but we just shrug it off. My mom is kind of like my break since I can be real with her all the time. She's like a sister at home.


Lately, she's been really easy to piss off and I just don't get it. Does she suddenly want what we do with my dad, or perhaps might be another issue that's been making her like this.

teenagers,Some guy in a discord server typed up an entire Phineas x Ferb fanfic in a #suggestions channel. Here you go:,"Okay here: Phineas pulled away from the intense, sensitive kiss, the corners of his mouth covered with messy saliva. It was his first. He had dreamed about this moment all of his teenage years. The adrenaline rushed to his stomach and bright cheeks in waves of warmth. He felt a bulge growing in his pants, chuckled softly, nuzzled his head and whispered “Hey Ferb..I think I know what we’re gonna do today.” A musical number faded in. Ferb leaned down to his stepbrother’s thin neck, coddling pockets of his skin in his mouth and sucking, nibbling, until a red mark was made. “I’m all yours, sir.” Phineas whispered, shaken. Ferb continued to paint his stepbrother’s body with marks of territory, settling his thumb in his prey’s mouth as Phineas lovingly sucked on it. Ferb grasped his non-blood relative’s hard triangular member and began to massage it. Suddenly, a rush of wind blew them from their moment. Candace walked out, screaming: “MOM, PHINEAS AND FERB ARE HAVING INCESTUAL RELATIONS!” but as the old tradition goes, everything was back to normal before their mother picked up any hint. Phineas speaks first. “Hey mom! Me and Ferb were wrestling. He won.” In a leathery, seductive, British voice Ferb speaks for the first and only time this episode: “Yes. Yes I did.” A final guitar riff marks the end of the sequence, and a commercial break begins.","Some guy in a discord server typed up an entire Phineas x Ferb fanfic in a #suggestions channel.

teenagers,My opinion on why tik tok is trash,"Now this is my opinion of you like it go ahead but I’ll list my reasons as to why I think tik tok is bad.

1. 70% of tik tok content is just people doing cringe dances to copyrighted songs. That’s objectively not entertaining on its own but it is hilarious seeing how people think their videos are so good.
Now these people probably couldn’t do what like 100 people have done before and be a pro tik toker but they probably could easily land a job as a clown in a circus. (Sorry if that sounds harsh)

2. I used to have tik tok for a month and I can safely say that only like 5% of people on that app have any real talent at what their trying to do. No dancing your ass of to dogshit music is not talent.
[this clip sums up the app](https://youtu.be/Fjp-TKnPatE)

3. Tik Tok has strange and dangerous trends like
the “corona challenge” where people lick toilet bowls (yes I know, disgusting) or that trend where people would dress like Holocaust victims and make videos in their perspective is also just tone deaf and not appropriate 

Now if you think this is just hive mind stuff it’s not.
I downloaded Tik tok before reddit and then deleted it after 1 month. This is genuinely my opinion and the reason this is a hive mind opinion is because a lot of people feel the same way about this app.

Now I’m sorry if this sounded harsh but I just needed to get it off my chest.","My opinion on why tik tok is trash Now this is my opinion of you like it go ahead but I’ll list my reasons as to why I think tik tok is bad.

teenagers,"How to break the ice of awkwardness between me (16) and my crush (17), when we both know that we kinda like each other?","Well, my backstory is kinda awkward.
I really started liking one guy in my class and several weeks ago, I wrote him an anonymous love letter to be delivered by my friend. (The letter wasn't anything that cheesy, though)
I know that guy and sometimes I talk or chat with him, but we're not that really close. Surprisingly, he took quite well to the letter, and certainly was interested, as my friend said later. Unfortunately, before he could send me his reply, we had a week full of term testing and just after that hell has passed, the government has issued a full lockdown on our entire city. 
Then my friend actually told that guy my identity (for which I'm still angry at her, she ows me a box full of chocolates), and two or three days later he chatted me himself. Even though he tried to be sweet and subtly hint at some things, he was still beating around the bush, talking about school and stuff. I began the chat first several times after that, and he does reply me enthusiastically, but we just can't to break the ice of awkwardness between us and get to the main point.

Do they not understand the fúcking point of the app??

For the rest there arent rules but they do prefer if you wear a mask. You only need to wear one while you are walking in school so not in class and when you are sitting during break. Keep in mind that you literally sit ass to ass with another because there are soo many people that have a break at the same time. Its not the problem to wear one but more that you are still very close to hundreds of people.

Let's name them A B and C,so me A and B are friends for about 4 years,the lowdown situation made it hard for us too hang out as do not really live at walking distance(A and B do) and the only place where we would meet was school which had been closed as of the pandemic.
A turned 13 today and threw a small party at her place I suprised her by showing up...well it had been 8 months since we saw each other even though we texted it felt kinda akward...anyways B and I chatted for a bit and then the never ending photoshoots and reel making begun and well I wasn't really included (cause I am ugly)
 and after a while I tried making small talk with A but she rather seemed busy chatting with C who she meet every single day(they are neighbours) I felt so I don't know how to explain...I felt hurt and sad C tried making me feel including but I clearly didn't belonged there.
I don't know crap about fashion and well C is an influencer,I am a redditor and well C is an instagrammer (is that a good or a bad thing?) Well I felt really jealous and frustrated...
And now I think maybe I am craving for attention and maybe cause didn't got it I felt desperate and sad
What should I do to make myself interesting and amusing enough to meet my friends standards.....
I am scared of losing them....","I felt left out at my bestie's birthday (pardon me for the grammer, English isn't my native language)

teenagers,Day 2 of my learning thingy,"Tl;Dr my progress bar basically didn't move at all

Layman terms: did some research, hit a dead end. Am retracing my steps but I lost a lot of time. 

Today I was just browsing through YouTube a little more to see if there are already tetris ai that I could use. My target is tetr.io so I was seeing if there's any ai for that website.

So I found this tetris ai guide that apparently the comments are bashing the video for plagiarising the code and that the guy teaching sucks at explaining. I might still try it out tho. I found another guy with a tetris ai as well, might do that too. 

Then I found another video about cold clear. It's wayy too complicated for me. I tried using their discord and asking how does one operate this ai and oh boy let me list them, maybe. 

1. The AI was coded in rust(a programming language) . I have intellij and visual studio code as the interpreter(basically something to let me look at the code of this ai) and boy do rust hate visual code on windows. Idk how to put rust into intellij, haven't tried it. Also I'm not learning another programming language screw that. 

2. To use this thing is hard. I'm gonna have to search through thousands of lines of code and reverse engineer it so that I can figure out what the hell does each folder of scripts do. Oh boy I am too inexperienced for that.

3. I'm not even that advanced. I asked and one of the discord member told me how to run the AI using python. I mean I could also just download another app in that discord and run it but apparently if I wanna use python, I gotta use experience to know how to use the AI in a Web browser. There's no tutorial for this. Or at least not that I could think of.

4. I was overwhelmed by the info that I just spent 5 hours on YouTube and other games including tetris because my brain just needs to rest. I could absorb anymore info for today.

At least I'm starting java script with code academy. Let's see where that takes me.","Day 2 of my learning thingy Tl;Dr my progress bar basically didn't move at all

Although I do give props to people who stay patient and dont escalate the situation because I could never do that that’s an amazing sense of self control and maturity

at this rate im not getting a job from school and my brain really can't stand looking at fucking books until I memorise everything Iisee in that, i just can't


summary: im 16, shit relationship with my parents and in 2 years I'll be working minimum wage at this rate except I won't because It'll jump off a goddam bridge if I have to life my life in shit

my current method of coping with this shit is games. but they won't solve anything in the future

the decent job part is important because i want to get the fuck out of this house and at least be just slightly happier...

(Or some shit like that) and I explained this to her too, well, her friends where there with her and one of them said ""all men deserve a punch in the dick"" (when she said that she actually tried to punch me in the dick) and ""all that men think is videogames and sex!"" The very next day one of these girls came in and showed her friend one of her dildos during lunch. And me and another one of my friends saw it too and when she saw us she frantically tried to hide it. I can safely say I wasn't expecting that. Now I am kinda angry at this group of girls.

teenagers,I finished iCarly for the Nintendo DS. And it's a masterpiece.,"As some of you may know I finished iCarly for the Nintendo DS and I am crying.

* The graphics were just great and revolutionary for the generation! I forgot a lot of the times I was playing a game!
* It has breast battle mechanics! Like you can just get shot in the eye and your character could become blind! Or even if someone breaks their leg you will need to wait for them!
* The soundtrack is so damn good! [A great example is the final boss music!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7sqdsq5UyQ)
* Controls are super responsive! Like I can bearly feel the DS I feel the game world! Like I felt the grass, blood, or even the bones!
* The game has great survival mechanics! Like you need to cook food at the precise temperature! Or how you need to kill other humans sometimes!
* Characters are realistic! Exactly like the show! Carly, the main character is so real... I felt her emotions! When she killed someone at first she cried and had a breakdown! But towards the end she was merciless! And the interactions! Like I won't spoil but an important person really loves them and dies from sadness after their death!
* The story is beautiful! The modern Srek, modern Mona Lisa, modern Evangelion but combined! I learned so so much from it! It changed my life! Not everyone comes out alive depending on your actions and how you play!
* The endings are beautiful! Here are some examples: &gt;!Carly sacrifices herself and saves the multiverse with her after Carly's many many murders in order to save everything makes everyone leave her, everyone dies, and even more!!&lt;
* DLC is done great! Some are sadly exclusives like to Japan or with the Cooking class DLC only available in Germany.

And guess what! A remake of iCarly is coming for PS5, XBSX, Nintendo Switch, Mobile, and PC! [Link to preorder.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

teenagers,Hey guys and girls I’m really confused ed right now ok so I started to karate a couple months ago and for myself I think I’m quite good but some wird shit happened like 10 min ago.,"Ok so I wanted to go for some extra training in karate because I wanna get better and (we have a Snapchat group those who go to it) so I’m that group I asked what to wear to the extra training and what time it was. And some people answered me good answers like gi pants and a t shirt and one girl ansver “William don’t come to extra training” she’s brown belt and she’s nice when we are at training. I then asked why? And she ansveref a kinda long text like the length off this text from the start to here. The text basically said “extra training are a very intense training and for people who want to go to tournaments and don’t come after a minute the text desapered and yea. After a min a other girl asks why I should not come (she didn’t see the text I think) right now I’m kinda confused and don’t know what to do

Sry for my bad English I’m from Denmark so yea","Hey guys and girls I’m really confused ed right now ok so I started to karate a couple months ago and for myself I think I’m quite good but some wird shit happened like 10 min ago.

teenagers,Why this gotta happen to me,"I posted previously on r/Advice regarding this matter. I feel like I'm dying. This Wednesday, I got a sick feeling in my stomach and thought it was just a stomach flu. One day later, I vomited 4 time simultaneously, got a fever of 38.7 c, and honestly I'm collapsing. I took some antibiotics and other anti vomit medicine (idk what they are called) and felt better for a day but now the pain is coming back at an alarming rate and it hurts. I dont think it is covid as I dont go out often (if ever), but it just feels like a severe flu. I need advice from you fellow teens the pain is devastating.","Why this gotta happen to me I posted previously on r/Advice regarding this matter. I feel like I'm dying.

I dont know why I wrote this but I just wanted to tell some People here that sometimes you can trust strangers more than your friends with your problems if you're uncomfortable to speak with them

teenagers,My parents think that I’m gay,"Before i start: i have nothing against lgbt+ people. 

So we were sitting as a family watching tv with my parents when an advertisement came. It was some kind of perfume with Dua Lipa starring inside. My mother looked at her than looked at me and asked:”she’s cute what do you think of her?” I never talked about girls at my house and i never mentioned being friends with any girl. Things got worse when i said:” I’m not interested in her or in any others.” 
My parents both stared at me with an angry and disgusted look. They started taking more distance and showed visible disgust when i played with the boys online. 

Well things got better when i started talking to girls. I was forced by myself to do it. Not complaining though. 
My parents seemed a bit relieved when i told them and i have now some girl friends (not girlfriend). 

In conclusion mistakes and accidents will make you a better man.","My parents think that I’m gay Before i start: i have nothing against lgbt+ people.

teenagers,Some lyrics I wrote ...,"Can you hold me ?


Please ,can you hold me in your arms
Thats all I want is just a hug 
I just want to feel your warmth 
Can you hold me ,in your arms 

Dark days and cold nights 
Are getting hard when there is no one by my side
And I swear I’ve tried , but it feels like I’m tied
Maybe you can help me ,turn on the lights 

I know I am a difficult person 
I want love , but I just won’t take it 
I know it’s selfish , to ask for help
And then reject it , 

But I swear I will change it all 
As long as you love me back 

Please ,can you hold me in your arms
Thats all I want is just a hug 
I just want to feel your warmth 
Can you hold me ,in your arms 

And I know you don’t know me 
But I’ve lost my faith , this is all I have left 
And I know it’s a sacrifice , no one is willing to make
Especially , when you don’t  know me that well

But I just want to wrap me in your arms
That’ll be enough to fix my broken heart
Just hold my hand ,and I promise everything will be alright
If you want , I promise everything will be alright 

I just want to hug you all night long 
I just to have someone to talk to 

Please ,can you hold me in your arms
Thats all I want is just a hug 
I just want to feel your warmth 
Can you hold me ,in your arms","Some lyrics I wrote ... Can you hold me ?

teenagers,I got Sexually Abused by a Bunch of Girls in Middle School and Just accepted it 5 years Later,"Hey r/teenagers, I've been lurking here for a while but I felt the need to post about some things. Just a warning this is poorly written but I need to get to a point where I can talk about this.

When I was in 6th and 7th grade there was a group of maybe four girls that touched me inappropriately. They were extremely casual about it, I would walk down the hallway and one of them would touch my ass without worry about being caught or berated or anything. They acted like it was their right. Because of that, and because I was taught by society that guys could not be sexually abused, I didn't tell anyone. Well, that's not totally true, I mentioned it to my friends, and I love those guys but they were just kinda like, ""okay, hot people problems, girls like you so much that they don't ask permission"" and moved on (I've been asked to model, but my friends oversell my attractiveness, I'm maybe a 6, and girls certainly don't like me that much). Though to be fair I talked about it as if it had happened once and they stopped when I asked them to. Regardless, this led to me feeling isolated and alone. 

I even questioned if it was a problem, my friends didn't think it was, the girls acted like it wasn't, and would do it in public and nobody would say anything (Looking back I just don't think anyone noticed). Finally, after about a school year and a half of that going on intermittently I was caught alone in a room with one of the girls. Now, I consider myself a nice guy and I wanted to walk up and kinda gently make her understand that I didn't like what she and her friends were doing.  So I walked up and told her that her touching me was really making me uncomfortable. I can't remember if she responded verbally but she did reach out and grabbed my ass just as a kind of ""fuck you"" that spoke louder than any rebuke. It was kind of like, *this is mine*.

I got it then. I finally understood why they were getting away with everything, and why I was so uncomfortable with telling on them. I grabbed her wrist and forced her hand away from me. I was really angry and in complete control. I was on the verge of punching her or something when I realized that that if she ran out of the room and told anyone that I had tried to rape them she would be believed, that if anyone walked in, I would be presumed to be the bad guy, the rapist not the molested. So I broke down, I sank to my knees and started crying. I felt trapped and I did the only thing that i felt I could. 

I talked.

I told her that I'm sure she's not a bad person but that she was really hurting me, and that she needed to stop. She bolted. I can't imagine what she was thinking and feeling in that moment.

After that the girls stayed away from me. I think that she had been a bit scared by how easily I overpowered him and then opened up emotionally. Because it was over I just kind of forgot. A couple of days ago I was in a conversation about my friends issued with molestation and I casually mentioned that I had been molested as well and she was like ""why haven't you told me that before?!?"". That got me thinking about it again. 

Later in an internet argument and I was complaining about how men's emotions are de legitimized and I mentioned the molestation and this well intentioned woman told me I was making it up. Those two events made me realize that I need to talk about this. Because here's the thing, there is a cultural thing where if you mention something like an dudes problem or a woman's problem and the reaction is always, yeah, well, here's how WE suffer. 

**Please listen, suffering is suffering.** I'm a strait white guy that is not socially awkward and relatively attractive. I am incredibly lucky, and because I am I delegitimized my suffering, that's why I undersold what was going on when talking to my friends. But everyone suffers, to different degrees, but nevertheless, all suffering is legitimate, and we need to recognize that. When I talk about being molested I'm not saying that women are not molested, as that person on internet interpreted it, and I'm not saying that men suffer more than women, that's bullshit. 

So cherish and listen to your emotions, you're suffering is as real as the starving kid in the middle east. It's not anywhere near as bad of course, but you still get to, and you still need to suffer, and talk about that suffering, and try to move on. For me it's been five years and I'm just now trying to figure out how to move on. It took a conversation with a girl friend who has suffered as I have to make me realize that I was not able, culturally, to move on, to complain and talk about it, like she was. The patriarchy and it's gender norms hurts men as well.

*Sorry I went on a bit of a tangent at the end but thanks for reading anyways! I don't think I'm going to respond to many comments because I'm still uncomfortable talking about this.*","I got Sexually Abused by a Bunch of Girls in Middle School and Just accepted it 5 years Later Hey r/teenagers, I've been lurking here for a while but I felt the need to post about some things.

Led Zeppelin 2-Led Zeppelin, Yes that’s right, the whole fucking album, from the obvious hits Whole lotta love to lesser known songs like The lemon song, this album is amazing 
Stairway to heaven-Led Zeppelin, can’t recommend Led Zeppelin without stairway
Good Times Bad Times-Led Zeppelin, absolutely killer beat, brilliant song
You can’t always get what you want-The Rolling Stones, The intro to this song put me off it for ages. It is in fact an absolute banger I’d just recommend skipping the initial 30-40 seconds
So the music without my ramblings are

teenagers,I got my P.E. teacher to write me an essay.,"Back in 6th grade, my P.E. class was playing lacrosse (I t might be more of a Maryland thing, so if you don't know what it is it is kind of like soccer but with sticks with nets on the end that you use to throw the ball instead of kicking it.) I was pretty bad at it and so was the rest of my team. One team started to get annoyed when we made minor infractions due to being beginners, so I started asking the other team to write 5 paragraph essays. Eventually our team was playing another team but I still had that joke in my head. The next team we played was very good and was destroying us to the point where the P.E. teacher joined our team. When the P.E. teacher announced that he would be joining our team, I asked him to write me an essay explaining why he decided to help us, because I still had that joke in my head at the time. The teacher then said that he would write the essay if I scored a goal, and by some miracle I did score a goal. So, later that week my P.E. teacher handed in an essay explaining why he helped our team out.","I got my P.E. teacher to write me an essay.

the code means that you should put your friends first. If your friend admits a crush, you should not try and steal the crush, in fact you should help your friend’s chances with them.

what happens if its like, a group of 3 boys and they’re all gay?

One has a crush on another. And confesses it to the third. how does that work? Like, I’m just curious, and would like to know your opinions","An interesting moral dillema. So we all know the bro code, right?  Bros before hoes, all that jazz.

teenagers,Crap - how a simple joke spirals.,"
So this this story goes back a couple years while I was dating this girl we will call Lily (that is not her name). This relationship was nearing 2 years but was very very stale the girl was neglectful and it wasn’t going anywhere. I felt trapped in it because this girl I was going to break up with was in the hospital about a month before so I didn’t want to be a huge asshole and break it up.  Anyways around this time I met a neighbor of my age who was pretty friendly and kind 
Who we will call Elsa (that isnt her name either. Anyway we didnt talk often but about 6 months and I didnt have any kind of crush. later that summer my former Girlfriend broke up with me and it was a big weight off of both of our shoulders. I still didnt have a crush on anyone but my parents were trying to get me to ask her out for some reason. I jokingly tell my friends about my parents urges and they thought I was talking about one of my younger neighbors. My friends start a long running joke about Elsa calling her my 4 year old neighbor. The joke lasted for years and more of my friend group heard about it. Finally the fateful day my friend liam met the girl at the park by total happenstance and we add her to a discord group chat. Another friend close to my old GF started DMing this girl thinking the joke is real. So she starts gossiping to her about how I deeply like this girl. At this point she has a boyfriend so she finds this story to be odd. Anyways the friend who we will call Allysa sets up an entire hang out so scripted in order to hint to me that she isnt into me. The truth is that I am most definitely not the girl was too much like my last GF. Anyways I being elsas friend invites her to friend hangouts to be nice and she thinks I was trying to ask her out. Elsas friend texted me that Elsa didn’t want to talk to me anymore because she thought I was being weird. So that is how a simple long lasting  joke about your parents and mixing friend groups leads to shit.","Crap - how a simple joke spirals.

teenagers,Do guys like to be asked out by strangers in public ??,"Hello there,
Boys of r/teenagers. I (15/f) got a question for y'all that me and a lot of other gals have been wondering..

Do you like being approached in public by a girl ( complete strangers, same age, assuming you are into girls)  and asked out on a date (or to hangout) or something ? If yes, then how would you prefer they do it? Like a cheesy pick up line, straight up etc. Also how would you react to this?","Do guys like to be asked out by strangers in public ?? Hello there,

It was right in the middle of a vacation to the keys, long story short they kicked all tourists out on day one. Overall this has been the worst year of my life. I was supposed to graduate this year but there was no big ceremony, only four other graduates and there immediate family came and the ""diploma"" we were given was ment nothing. I spent all summer at home playing video games. I grinded out a full tech tree in War Thunder a feat that would take most players a year at least. I have never been good at making friends. I've only seen the few of them I have once or twice all year. It's been difficult to keep my spirits up. I've been trying to get a job all year but nobody wants to hire someone with no experience in this pandemic. Especially someone who is so socially awkward he can barely get through an interview. The reason my diploma is useless is because I've been homeschooled all my life. My mom is a  certified teacher so I've maybe got a better education than most public schoolers, but since I'm not registered to a school I don't have a ""real"" education according to the state. And without a high school diploma recognized by the system, the only thing on my resume is volunteer hours. On the bright side I was able get into college after a lot of fighting and testing. But all of my classes are online so it's like I'm still homeschooled, except the teacher's have been absent and neglectful of the whole class I'm barely passing because I got some sort of flu or cold that gave such a high fever right at midterms and I failed them horribly.

Lately I've been doing better though winter finals are right around the corner and I'm sort of back on track. Thanksgiving was pretty good I sent out text messages to all my friends wishing them a Happy Thanksgiving. One of them responded and we texted back and forth for a while. I'm still out of a job but the minimum wage was just raised and I'm pretty sure Biden is president. We had another vacation to the blue ridge mountains where I climbed to the top and cried at the view. Christmas is a month away and I think my cousin's are coming down from New York. So life still has a lot of problems but I need to look on the bright side so I don't kill myself. This year sucks I don't expect 2021 to be much better but its something to look forward to.

Happy Thanksgiving, God bless and come soon New Year from your boy Zayzoo.","2020 sucks Hey my name is Zayzoo, well not really that is just my screen name.

At some point the one who helps feels very tired""

teenagers,"Can anyone help me, or listen?"," 

I've always tried to find a life school balance, but that's never worked, my rooms a mess, my bathrooms a mess and of course, my life is too.

Recently a kid at our school threatened a bunch of my friends life, me and my best friend reacted quickly and harshly. The kid pushed my best friend threatening to stab him. We'll just call my best friend huh Pete, and this kid john. So John, after shoving Pete and threatening to stab him, john threatens to stab his girlfriend and me. So Pete lunges at him, clocks him right in the jaw, being quite large and strong for my age, i step in as Johns two friends go to attack Pete, i hit the one sending him to the floor unconscious and throw the other on the floor.

A few hours later John threatens our lives with his older brother, we will just call him cunt.

A little background cunt is a high school thug, he has his roots imbibed in every druggie.

Luckily my older sister's boyfriend is a friend of cunts, and he saved our skin. But threatened my sisters life if it happens again.

I met Cunt the other day and just said to him, ""You're friends might kill me, but if you hurt my family, they won't be able stop me from killing you."" Luckily he backs off.

So here i am, trying to balance everything at once, to stop my friends from getting stabbed, and my family from being killed.

Of course there is much more, but unfortunately i can't go into it.

But the worst part is my local mental health service is currently down so i have no one to talk to, so i hope i can talk to one of you, i'm trying to not spiral and also not comatose.

(PS sorry, English is my native language, but i'm really tired, paranoid and anxious.)","Can anyone help me, or listen?

teenagers,About my crush,"I talked to her yesterday,  and i cant decide whether it went well or not, i didn't confess anything i just tried to have a normal convo.

Positives:
-She replied instantly
-It was not a dry convo at all, she was responsive and said things like ""hahahaha"" and stuff
-When i said ""gn"" she said gn back with a heart emoji.


Negatives:

-When i asked her what she's been up to, she didn't ask me back, basically she wasn't asking me anything the whole conversation, it was just me starting.
-I asked her if she wanted to play among us later, she said no cause she's probably gonna sleep early today, then i saw her online at 3am, and this is the worst thing about all of it.

What y'all think ? I think im in the friendzone tbh.

(I've known her properly for a month now, last time we saw each other was 2 years ago at school and we weren't friends since she was in another class, and recently we followed each other on instagram)","About my crush I talked to her yesterday,  and i cant decide whether it went well or not, i didn't confess anything i just tried to have a normal convo.

teenagers,I’m turning 20 tomorrow so for my final post here’s 10 things that I think most people should know and what has helped me,"1. Just be yourself and stop caring about what your peers think about you and trying to “fit in” at school. Chances are after you graduate you’ll never see any of those people again

2. Avoid cigarettes/vaping/drugs at all costs. It’s not worth it. For me avoiding that stuff was the best thing I could have done throughout high school.

3. Listen to your parents and do what they ask of you. Chores and rules etc. (it’s even better if you do your chores without being asked) this will help build trust between you and your parents so that as you grow older they will give you more freedom to do the things you want to do. 

4. Save your money. Don’t spend money on things that are a short fad or just seem cool at the time. Buy stuff that will last a long time be useful to you. Your future self will thank you

5. Get a bank account as soon as your old enough and start putting money in a saving account for your future self. (Get a part time job if possible) as a bonus a part time job will help you build trust in your parents

6. Don’t start dating just because your friends/peers are doing it. Wait until your old enough and mature enough to handle a relationship. I avoided a lot of drama in high school because I avoided dating. 

7. Suicide Is never the right thing to do. Get help because there are people in your life that will miss you and the pain of losing a family member/friend is the hardest thing in life to get through. You also still have so much to live for and you can grow up to be an amazing person

8. When looking to buy your first car always take a family member/friend with you who knows a lot about cars. If buying used always look for a vehicle that is already safetied and want require a lot of maintenance in the first few years of owning it. Avoid expensive brand names because they will always be more expensive to fix

9. Focus on your academics and not on trying to fit in with the popular kids in school. Especially in high school focusing on graduating and passing your classes is very beneficial to you.

10. Choose classes in high school that you will enjoy. Stuff like calculus is mostly not important unless you are going to need it for college/university. Don’t put more work on yourself than is necessary by taking more difficult classes. Take the classes that will teach you skills you want to learn and will make you happy","I’m turning 20 tomorrow so for my final post here’s 10 things that I think most people should know and what has helped me 1.

7. Suicide Is never the right thing to do. Get help because there are people in your life that will miss you and the pain of losing a family member/friend is the hardest thing in life to get through. You also still have so much to live for and you can grow up to be an amazing person

8. When looking to buy your first car always take a family member/friend with you who knows a lot about cars. If buying used always look for a vehicle that is already safetied and want require a lot of maintenance in the first few years of owning it. Avoid expensive brand names because they will always be more expensive to fix

9. Focus on your academics and not on trying to fit in with the popular kids in school. Especially in high school focusing on graduating and passing your classes is very beneficial to you.

10. Choose classes in high school that you will enjoy. Stuff like calculus is mostly not important unless you are going to need it for college/university. Don’t put more work on yourself than is necessary by taking more difficult classes. Take the classes that will teach you skills you want to learn and will make you happy"

teenagers,I feel crushed.,"Boys, pro tip: If you intend on making your own TrackIr setup, *please* use a voltage around 9 Volts. A block battery will do, better even if it's rechargable.

I just finished glueing my ""trident"" together and it turns out I got it all wrong. Everything I touch gets ruined, everything I build is a waste of materials.","I feel crushed.

When I got to school I was still mad, I had my headphones in on full volume. My mum said something to me and I muttered ""have a shit day"" but becasue I had headphones in i didn't realise how loud i said it.
I heard my dad exclaim, then realising what I said i slammed the car door and bolted to school.

teenagers,"just a rant, dont mind me. [tw: abuse i guess]","i just need to get this out here since I have noone to talk to about this. I've turned 18 and in the past year, I realized how terrible my childhood was.

My dad used to hit me a lot. He said he did it to discipline me, because he loved me and that he wasn't like the other evil dads on TV because he was sober when he hit me.

He said that it's a mercy that he struck me on the buttocks with a belt, because any other place would cause serious injury.

As he hit me, he would tell me not to cry because our family is a proud family. One that never cries or shows sadness. he's right, i guess. I've never seen anyone from my family express sadness other than my very young siblings and cousins. Of course, they'd be screamed at and hit if they cried so I guess they'll stop expressing sadness soon enough.

Whenever I messed up- broke a plate, ate too slow, put the wrong name on a test, I'd get punished for it. Whenever I apologized he'd tell me not to. To just shut up and accept the punishment. So I did. Instead of apologizing, I've tried to hide all the bad things I do. Apologizing gets me hurt more. Making noise, screaming, crying when I get hit makes him hit me harder. And If I ask for help from my teachers, he'd say that I'm just being overdramatic. Begging for help is weak. Even to this day, when I mess up badly, i expect my friends to explode at me in anger. They usually dont. They're kind. But I hate that- I feel really bad. I feel like I'd rather just get hit then and there. i'd rather they just hit me. I feel like nothing bad happening to me after I've done something wrong to them is unfair. I accidentally broke a classmate's jar back in 9th grade. I apologized profusely, but I fully expected them to get mad at me. My mind was conjuring up what they'll say to me. Bracing me for what things they'll say to me, things I fully deserve for breaking their jar. And she just forgave me. ""It's okay."" I cried then. I just cried and kept apologizing and I embarrassed myself so much.

\-

I was a slow eater as a child. Like, hours for a meal. So to fix this, my dad would sit by my side whenever I ate at home. After I put food into my mouth, he'd start pinching at my sides, twisting it more and more until I showed him that I already swallowed my food. He'd do it again and again until i've done eating. Once, I just- I don't know what happened. I just forgot how to swallow? I'd try to swallow but my throat would just close up and not- I don't know what happened then. But my sides hurt even more. Those times, i had to drink water just to force myself to swallow.

\-

There was this one time, I was in elementary and lived with him and his girlfriend. I don't remember what I did then but I remember what he did to me. He bound my feet together and hung me upside down on a wood protrusion inside our home. He spun me around and lightly poked me with the point of scissors. I couldnt stop myself from crying out so it just hurt more.

\-

My dad used to be the guy who taught me maths. As a kid I was supposed to be this math smartass. My dad would push me to being the best i could be. He screamed at me when I got answers wrong. He'd hit my head with a pencil. I know it's not that severe, but I've grown to hate studying lmao. He'd count to ten and if I couldnt answer by then, I'd get hit by a pencil. If I got it wrong, I'd get hit by a pencil. I hated it so much that once, while taking a shower, I tried to raise my head up on the tap? I hit my head there so that it'd bleed. So I'd get a wound on my head. I'd go to my grandparents and ""boast"" about how my dad would hit me whenever I got the answers wrong. I treated this wound like a battle scar. Maybe I was just pleading for help. I don't know. I did genuinely believe that all these punishments were necessary for me to grow to be a good person. That people who didn't get hit are evil maniacs but also soft weaklings.

I just want to write this all down- to just say it out there. i guess that's it. love you guys, babush.","just a rant, dont mind me.

teenagers,How do you guys clean your sex brick?,"Title. It's pretty simple. I recently got a sex brick and I'm wondering how you guys clean yours.

I think the main issues I have right now are the smell that the little storage/waste disposal portion has, and coming up with a legitimate reason to have a brick with one suspiciously smooth hole in my room.

teenagers,A problem I’ve noticed recently about racial discrimination,"Fat wall of text warning

Asians living in the west, especially in the US (I can’t speak for other countries because I live in the US), have recently been facing increased discrimination and hate crimes, especially due to the Covid-19 pandemic, public figures who are supposed to be decent people (or at least not using their position to be asshats) using rhetoric like “Kung Flu” or “Chinese virus”, and the recently increased saber-rattling between the PRC and USA. Even second generation immigrants who have lived their entire lives here, and even Asians that aren’t of Chinese descent like Koreans, Japanese, Vietnamese etc. have been catching shit over this.

And for some reason people seem to mostly be ok with it? Like what the hell? People can go and say there’s no discrimination against Asians in the west and then they’re able to make racist jokes about supposed bat-eating or some shit and get away with it, or you see something about some assholes beating up an old lady for existing as Asian near them and hate crimes being up by something like 2000%, or MSNBC privately banning their reporters from interviewing Andrew Yang, some district in Washington no longer counting Asian people as Asian (officially recategorized as white) because (reasons), or Newsweek accusing 600 Chinese-American organizations of being communist sleeper cells without any evidence, etc.

The worst part about this is that all the people who are _supposed to_ speak out against it or actively try to prevent it seem like they either just feel uncomfortable and want to pretend things like this aren’t happening, or are perfectly okay with it and will encourage it because they think it’s right for some reason. And people of all races even including Asians try to do this coverup type of thing. Dialogue on race (in the US, again idk about other countries) doesn’t include us at all, just like in the rest of this country’s politics

My point being that people need to be aware of this and it needs to stop, thanks for coming to my crappily written Ted Talk","A problem I’ve noticed recently about racial discrimination Fat wall of text warning

Then she texted me talking about school and stuff and playing online games. It lasted until March this year and rejected me again. She told me that she feels guilty for not having any feelings for me and told me that we should stop texting because dhe doesn't want me to be hurt anymore. It hurt again. But it didn't feel like the first rejection. The first rejection felt more heartbreaking. Then she came back again texting me saying ""yo how's life?""  So I was happy. We started texting each other again everyday and sometimes I tell her I miss her and shit like that and got rejected everytime. Then today, i just got rejected again that made me stop saying the i miss you shits. This time it made me feel scarred. But it also feels like it didn't hurt at all. I've been getting rejected almost everyday. These rejections doesn't hurt me anymore. Its like i have a heart of stone now.

teenagers,Something weird happened today,"I was at a math class with 4 other kids in someone's house (i am from Egypt so we do that weird stuff) 

Most of us didn't do the homework we had so i explained that i had an exam so i couldn't do it

He told me jokingly to switch to a different system were i take same subjects over 2 years instead of one year (as in you have more time and stuff)

So one kid (the owner of the house) asked more about it

And he kept asking during the class and eventually said ""okay i am skipping math and physics till next year"" 

He said that to the math teacher during math class

I don't think he understood that this rude so we just laughed with him even the teacher did laugh 

Then he kept asking and asking even more and he even said ""should i even be here with you "" and stuff like that

And he refused to participate for a while and kept asking

Till the teacher told him to shut up and said he isn't coming again and this is the last class he is giving him problem is he was owner of the house 

So the teacher (after we left ) told us to choose some other kid's house to take lesson there

I wrote too much

But it was just too awkward to be there and see the teacher be angry at the kid and act as if it was normal","Something weird happened today I was at a math class with 4 other kids in someone's house (i am from Egypt so we do that weird stuff)

teenagers,That one compliment that makes me sad.,"""OMG, ur so smart!!!""

It's nice to give compliments, but only if they're relevant and...  y'know... **true**

People keep calling me soooo much smarter than everyone but then I look at my grades and it'sbarely above the average, and I feel like everyone is lying to me about it, I've heard it enough to actually think I'm more potent than everyone, but then I see I'm just as smart as anyone else, which makes me sad.

I've heard it enough, and I'm starting to ignore compliments automatically, even if it isn't ""you're smart"", which makes me think noone's complimenting me anymore, which makes me sad.



Moral of the story: don't give a compliment in an exagerrating manner to someone if they're average at the thing you're complimenting them for.","That one compliment that makes me sad. ""OMG, ur so smart!!!""

teenagers,So my conspiracy theory loving history teacher is telling us to live free against the government during the pandemic.,"On an unrelated note, one of his coworkers died from covid, a couple more are in the hospital, and his cousin, a nurse, is making cynical jokes about the therapy she needs from the excess deaths. 
     While I love interesting and well crafted conspiracy theories that give you an idea of a different way things panned out, and when he tells us these stories, he is always entertaining. But even after what happened, he will still probably believe in something actively harmful, even after it hit his workplace.

teenagers,I lost my mom to covid the day before thanksgiving,"Around October 15th my mom began to display symptoms of covid and on the 18th of October she was taken to the hospital cause she couldn’t breathe. On the 28th of October she was put on a ventilator machine. The hospital called us to tell us they had no other option and my mom sounded terrified. Our final conversation together occurred that morning. They needed me to convince her to agree to it. So my final conversation with her consisted of me telling my terrified mother that she needs to do this for us. I told her I loved her and then she was put on the ventilator.

I think I regret allowing them to do that. I knew in my heart that she wouldn’t survive this but I was selfish and convinced her to do it anyway and now I have to live with that guilt for the rest of my life. The following weeks were the shittiest weeks of my life.

They called me on the 25th of November to tell me my mom would die later that day. They allowed my family and I to enter the ICU to see her but through a glass window. I wasn’t allowed talk to her, hold her hand, or even be in the same room as her. She was unconscious and unaware that we were there with her. I feel like a horrible human being for not being able to let her know she wasn’t alone. All I can think about is how alone she must have felt before she drifted into unconsciousness.

I have nothing but hatred towards everyone who refuses to take this virus seriously. I wish these people so much misfortune and I don’t care if that makes me a horrible person. I wish the president an awful life and I hope he suffers more than my mother did. And for those who do take this virus seriously, I have nothing but love for you and I hope you don’t lose a loved one to this virus and if you have then I am truly sorry","I lost my mom to covid the day before thanksgiving Around October 15th my mom began to display symptoms of covid and on the 18th of October she was taken to the hospital cause she couldn’t breathe.

teenagers,Am I a bad person for breaking up?,"Am I a bad person?

I haven’t actually broken up yet but I’m going to Tuesday after school cuz that’s the next time I see her if I don’t see her this weekend. I’ve been dating this girl for the past 4 months but I feel like it’s time to go our separate ways. She was my first everything from first kiss from first time... she was even with me the first time I smoked weed. But there are two main reasons. The first is that we’re shifting apart as she’s becoming more and more of a sensitive ACAB alt girl I’m going back to the old me who didn’t give a fuck about things. Which brings me to my second point which is that her alt personality consumed me and made me unhappy and I just wanna spend more time with my friends cuz having a girlfriend is so time consuming. The main secondary reason is that she cares so much about shit like she’ll get mad at me when I say r*tarded and she’ll say ew when she sees a cop car which just makes me cringe at how childish she is sometimes. The sad part is that she loves me so much and even tho I talked a lot of shit about her in this post, I still have a lot of respect for her and I’d never wanna hurt her. My best friend also broke up with her best friend like a week ago to make matters worse so I feel like she’s gonna hate me after I break up which is the last thing I want. She’s also gonna start working so we’ll only be able to hangout after 6 and since she lives far away a it take like an hour to get there. If you’re still reading  thank you for taking the time out of your day. :) Please give advice.","Am I a bad person for breaking up? Am I a bad person?

Maybe someone who’s in that sub can help me with this but why is that sub so large and so accepted?

From what I’ve seen, it usually pokes fun at white people and how they’re awful

And we’ll, the whole point of the sub is “black people being funny”..... isn’t that completely ironic

Because surely if we should not judge someone by the colour of their skin, we also shouldn’t have a whole sub dedicated to how funny black people are  and how bad white people are. 

This can be done vice-versa too. If there’s subs claiming a race is super funny and another is A, B and C, I find it stupid too

But someone enlighten me lol","Why is r/blackpeopletwitter a thing? Why is r/blackpeopletwitter a thing?

teenagers,Hello fellow Reddit addicts! I have a challenge for you,"So, i'm gonna do an experiment with myself. 31 days, no Reddit. For the entire month of December i'm not going to use reddit and i invite you to do the same. Now if you aren't as much of a Reddit addict as me you can just move on with your day. This post is tailored for the procrastinating, lazy and gets nothing done cuz they on Reddit all day types. If that's you i invite you to go do something else than Reddit for a month.

Reddit Free Spree (RFS) is what i've called this challenge. The rules are as followes:

\- Absolutely NO [Reddit.com](https://Reddit.com) or Reddit app. No form of scrolling Reddit is allowed

\- You are allowed to recieve memes from friends and search up memes yourself. But going on Reddit is stricly forbidden

\- The challenge starts at 12AM or 00:00 in your timezone December 1st. And ends when the new year starts

\- If a friend send a reddit link, that is also forbidden. You must keep off this website

This challenge is like NNN, where the goal is to resist the urge of going on Reddit. So more about self control than a punishment. If you are interested but have no idea of what to do with your new free time, heres some ideas:

\- Read a book

\- Hang out with friends

\- Try to learn a new skill (Instrument, cooking or somethin like that)

\- Exercise

\- Spend time with familly

\- Play a sport

Thats just some examples of the top of my head. If you wish to join this challenge i will be posting a follow up post in 2021 about my experiences and things ive done. For thoose interested i request you post your story in the comment of said post. If anyone is interested i would love to hear what youve done with your extra time.

Remember im not forcing you into anything. Its just a dumb challenge for others like me.

(Btw im not THAT good at english, so if there are any grammar errors that is expected. And i dont bother changing them if they are pointed out lmao.)","Hello fellow Reddit addicts!

teenagers,Absolute fucking madlad,"So, as we all know, a lot of girls have used the excuse ""Girl Problems"" to get out of a class

Well today, one of my (guy) friends decied to see if it was the same case for us

The first class we had with a female teacher he walked up and asked if he could leave, when asked why, he leaned in and whispered ""guy problems""

The teacher was more red than a tomato with tomato sauce on it and she nodded silently, like 5 minutes after he left she then went out on the excuse that she was going to find him

Its been like 10 minutes and neither have returned to class, so either my guy is getting laid by the teacher or she hasnt found him yet","Absolute fucking madlad So, as we all know, a lot of girls have used the excuse ""Girl Problems"" to get out of a class

teenagers,I just won an argument between my parents today!,"I may sound like an asshole for saying this but I really wouldn't have been more proud than myself after that.

Backstory time. My dad is strict, back when I was in middle school he literally slapped the shit outta me just because I ignore my grandma's word for telling to stay and have a little chat. Whenever he asked me to do something and I didn't do it, he would always humiliate me and leaves me no room to talk back.

Just recently, after I entered highschool I immediately became the ""smart kid"" in the class for the first time. I was never the type to study but after I parted ways with my really good friends I decided to improve myself to make both my parents and friends proud. Apparently, that wasn't good enough for him so he decided to take away my laptop and tell me to spend more time with the family. Although that may sounds like a good reason, that wasn't his intention. He literally told me to have a chat with my grandparents for at least 5 mins everyday. This might only be me but my grandparents gives zero fucks about my stories so this whole thing is just pointless.

After I tried to explain to him that his plan is just going to fail and he should give me back my laptop because it's almost weekends where everyone should be able to enjoy themselves, he said no! And at that point, the war broke out and after pulling out every facts that I can, I won, I cried so much during the arguments between both of my mom and dad that I feel like I'm the one who lost. 

That feels both good and terrible at the same time, idk why.","I just won an argument between my parents today! I may sound like an asshole for saying this but I really wouldn't have been more proud than myself after that.

Later on I joined the hololive subreddit and other social medias. I found out that Holo calls its members straight up ""talents"". Through watching even more I got to know that most of them are pretty young and are in the part of their life where they go to universities etc. That's when I took a look at myself and realized I am pretty much only a few years behind that stage of life and I'm extremelly untalented. I can literally do nothing, because everything I tried I quitted to early because it wasn't enjoyable. It's not even about being jealous or dreaming of being like those anime girls, I just realized what a human can be and that I'll never be like thay because I don't have the strength or endurance. I feel like a lower form of being, a wasted potential.","I am feeling existentially sad because I realized something about myself.

teenagers,My brother bought reddit coins with my money,"Okay so pretty much my brother pinned me down and stole my phone, which was still unlocked. It was open on Reddit and he saw that there was a thanksgiving sale on reddit coins. He jokingly clicked on it and saw that one had reduced in price by a lot and said he was going to buy it. He then handed me back my phone and there was a message thanking me for buying reddit coins. I have no idea how much he spent, but he said it wasn’t a lot. I’m not sure wether I should laugh or cry.","My brother bought reddit coins with my money Okay so pretty much my brother pinned me down and stole my phone, which was still unlocked.

teenagers,I wish i could hibernate.,"For like, around 5 million years pls, 

Men will die out then cuz the Y chromosome is disappearing, and since we figured out that two women can have biological children because there is sperm located in the bone marrow or something like that, and the child will always be a girl so technically soon enough men will go extinct.

Damn finally I will be able to take a walk in the night without being scared of being raped or murdered :)

(This is mostly a joke btw it’s just me wanting to rant a little, I do not wish death upon anyone. Unless you’re an asshole then you might be an exception.)","I wish i could hibernate. For like, around 5 million years pls,

teenagers,my family does not care about my mental health,A lot happened when uni started. Im a first year student and i am failing my life. So i picked comp sci cuz i was told to. My sister graduated from software engineering and she’s earning a lot. The problem is comp sci is literally not my thing at all. Im not talented in that area. No matter how hard i try i just cant code. I broke up with my gf when uni started and i was devastated. It did change me a lot cuz i was serious about it. I tried to catch up my uni work. Now im just behind for everything. I made like 0 friends cuz everything is online and i dont live in campus. I rely on my high school friends to help cuz i can barely do my work. I stay at home everyday and i lost interest for everything. I want to change my major but then its like reapplying for uni again. I have 0 motivation to do anything and its getting worse. I am failing this english course. There was a dropping deadline date. I thought i could catch up eventually but no. I have so many missing assignments. I asked for academic concession and they need proof. Bruh I literally mald everyday and i didnt see a doctor. I did call my family doctor twice but that was becuz i couldnt sleep at all and they dont allow face to face appointment. I dont have any proof that i am ill cuz i dont ask for help. Im literally stuck here. And then my family fking force me to do shit. To this point i have no idea why im listening to them anymore cuz im living in their expectation and they roast me for being useless. No one wanted this to happen. I lost interests for everything. I used to play games read manga play soccer and now i find them boring and i just dont have time to do them anymore. I tried to find some new interests but nothing makes me happy at all. As i said i didnt go outside in a while. Last time i went out was a month ago. I went out by myself cuz i wanted to die but then I realized im just too pussy to kill myself. My friends invited me to go out but i just hate seeing people. My friends are in other unis. I dont know what is wrong with me cuz everyday when i wake up i want to vomit. I cry out of no where too. I feel so hopeless. Like i know i can do better than this but my mental health brings me down. Im just constantly down and my family  doesnt care. They just say i need to be more mature and stop complaining. Bro i cant even do my uni work how tf do i continue this. Btw im trying to change my major to art and then they were like u are not gonna find a job in the future and u gonna beg. Its true but there are so many jobs out there i dont have to always stick to what I studied. Im malding i took melatonin like two hours ago and now im on my bed typing this. I just cant sleep.

teenagers,Bedrock or Java. Doesn't matter. I just see minecraft,"I judge people on how they act on the platform they play on, not on what they play on. For example, the TG Server. Almost 90% of the Java players there blame bedrock for everything and they're just toxic about bedrock in general.

Then when earth came out, the Java players that hated bedrock players started taking advantage of ""bedrockies"" since we dont have the pvp on or off feature on earth. 

I tried going onto a TG Podcast once, gave some solid reasons. The host, who I will call dvt, asked me if I was a bedrockie. And I replied with yes. Then dtv said, ""not gonna happen"". I thought to myself for a moment, thought if what I did it wrong or if he wasn't accepting people at the moment. I later found out that that guy had a big hate for bedrock players. I kinda felt sad because I really wanted to go on that podcast. But whatevs

td;lr Don't judge people for what platforms they play on ya dingis

Almost 90% of the Java players there blame bedrock for everything and they're just toxic about bedrock in general.

Then when earth came out, the Java players that hated bedrock players started taking advantage of ""bedrockies"" since we dont have the pvp on or off feature on earth. 

I tried going onto a TG Podcast once, gave some solid reasons. The host, who I will call dvt, asked me if I was a bedrockie. And I replied with yes. Then dtv said, ""not gonna happen"". I thought to myself for a moment, thought if what I did it wrong or if he wasn't accepting people at the moment. I later found out that that guy had a big hate for bedrock players. I kinda felt sad because I really wanted to go on that podcast. But whatevs

td;lr Don't judge people for what platforms they play on ya dingis

(P.S. not saying all Java players are like this and not saying all bedrock players are in the clear either. These were just my thoughts and written from personal experience on the server)"

teenagers,Tips on getting girls,"Step 1: Be a nice, compassionate gentlemen and check your feelings to make sure you like her, not just her looks

Step 2: Find an inconspicuous way to start talking to her. For instance my current girlfriend made a funny social media post which I replied to

Step 3: just talk, like a friend almost. Ask her if she’s okay maybe. Talk about stuff. I’m a nerd, do not tell her about MTG and D&amp;D right off the bat

Step 4: while you’re talking compliment her a few times, not constantly though, just make her feel special

Step 5: make jokes or slight hints towards a relationship, this is used to feel out the ground ahead

Step 6: if you think there’s even the slightest chance she says yes, go for it. If she does like you easy, if not, at least you’re not hung up on the same girl for ages. And if she says ewwww, fuck her, didn’t deserve you anyway

Patented works 100% of the time so far. Once tried walking up to girl and just straight up asking if she wants to go out as a baseline. 10/10 would not recommend. This has worked 4/4 times although my blue eyes may provide slight bonus","Tips on getting girls Step 1: Be a nice, compassionate gentlemen and check your feelings to make sure you like her, not just her looks

teenagers,Do I have no life?,"Im awkward around every living being on this planet, I can't hold a conversation, and I've never had any relationships.

 Im not trying to sound pissy or anything, but no joke i actually have 0 friends. Not 1 person am i actually friends with, nor have i ever really had a friend besides my early school years. I've never gone over to anyone's house, no one has ever been over at my house. A good amount of females are interested in me until they find out how ""boring"" and awkward I am. Im not putting myself down, that's just who i am. 
I sense that a lot of people are uncomfortable when talking to me because it's quite awkward. 
I am very attentive so i also notice that people tend to avoid sitting by me and avoid putting themselves in situations that would lead them to talk to me. Im not too worried about any of this, I just wonder if this will be my life forever, because this is how its been since i was a pre-teen. 

I do find it disheartening that It's difficult for me to form any type of real bond with anyone, especially females, but life goes on and I'll continue to see where it takes me.","Do I have no life?

teenagers,To all the teens who think they don’t matter,"You do matter! Would you not be here for a reason. To those who post about this feeling of not mattering you do matter I say. Do the animals of the Earth not matter? Surely if they matter you are more valuable than they. We need them to live, so you maybe asking what’s the point. The point is if the animals that do not have the same mind and love we do matter then surely you a human who can feel and sees these things does matter. If that doesn’t make sense then perhaps this will. We all matter to someone there’s always going to be at least one girl or boy who thinks the world of you. It may not seem like it but it’s true. There will always be one person who cares about you. It may be the bus driver on the way to school who wants to see all the faces of those he sees everyday. Then again maybe not it may be a teacher or dean who cares. If none of these then perhaps a neighbor who watches from a distance because they want to help in their own way. Maybe it’s none of these perhaps for some not all it so your grandparents, parents, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, or hell maybe it’s your 4th cousin twice removed, but the point is YOU MATTER TO SOMEONE!!!!","To all the teens who think they don’t matter You do matter!
